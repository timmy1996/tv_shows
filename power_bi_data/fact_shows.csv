1000300041,Homicide: Life on the Street,1993-01-31,7.0,TV-14,"This series was the most reality-based police drama that has ever aired on television.  It was shot entirely with handheld cameras on location in the Fells Point Community of Baltimore, MD.  One of the series' executive producers, Barry Levinson, is a Baltimore native.  He has written and directed at least three films that take place in Baltimore: ""Diner"", ""Tin Men"" & ""Avalon"".  Doing this show was a natural for him.

The series was based on a book called ""Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets,"" by David Simon, a writer who spent a year with the members of Baltimore's homicide unit.  Some of the series' characters and cases were based on the book.

This series was unlike most cop shows of that time, in that there were almost no car chases, gunfights and etc.  This show was about closing cases and the act of the crime was usually never seen.  Generally, the viewer first sees the case when the detective(s) arrive on the scene.  Open cases are kept track of on a board, open cases under the primary detective's name are shown in red ink, when the case is closed the red is replaced by black ink.  During the first season it aired, it didn't have great ratings and the chances for a second season looked bleak.  When Steven Bochco's NYPD Blue premiered in the Fall of '93 and got great ratings, police dramas ""were in"" and the series was given the go-ahead for a second season (the two Emmy Awards probably didn't hurt either).  The better ratings of the second season led to a full third and subsequent seasons.  When the Lifetime cable channel picked the show up for syndication in 1997 it helped guarantee that there would be a fifth season.  Then NBC made it possible for the series to have a sixth and seventh season.

With the great cast, acting, writing, and directing the series has won awards including a few Emmy Awards, Writer's Guild Awards and George Foster Peabody Awards.  Most of these awards were earned by Tom Fontana, one of the series' executive producers, whose other credits include St. Elsewhere.  In the 1995-1996 television season Andre Braugher was finally nominated for Best Actor in a Drama.  While he didn't win that year, two years later in the 1997-1998 television season he was again nominated, this time the Television Academy recognized what we already knew, that Andre Braugher was the best actor working in television drama.

One of the highlights of the series, starting with the second season was the use of music.  All varieties of music have been featured throughout the series, most often it was featured in a montage of the detectives conducting their investigation.

Treat them greatly, and they will show themselves to be great."" - David Brent. The Office tells a story of a few people working in a British office working hard to not lose their jobs. This hilarious comedy won a Golden Globe award for best comedy series. It was created by Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant. David Brent (Ricky Gervais) is a manager of low intelligence and has no sense of humor, but is convinced that he is the best, the most entertaining and the most well liked boss of all time.Today the show has been sold in more than 60 countries and it even had a remake in America. The Office is the first non-American show nominated in the category of best television musical or comedy for a Golden Globe Award; and Ricky Gervais was the first non-American actor nominated for the lead role in a television comedy for the same award. The Office won both awards and left Sex and the City & Matt LeBlanc empty handed. When the series aired the first season, they did not even know how popular it would get in some future episodes. The fact that its release on the DVD format proved to be the BBC's best selling comedy release shows its mass popularity and appeal.The writers at the start did not imagine that a second season would be created and after bowing to pressure to create one they would not do it again for a third.

1000301274,Battlestar Galactica (2003),2004-10-18,4.0,TV-14,"The Best Show on Television? Yes, according to Time Magazine, The National Review, Rolling Stone and New York Newsday. Praised by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The San Francisco Chronicle, The Chicago Tribune and many other publications, Battlestar Galactica won a prestigious Peabody Award in the spring of 2006.

Ronald D. Moore, the producer of Carnivale and writer for Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, boldly re-imagined the original 1978 space opera of humans versus the robotic Cylons. He teamed up with fellow executive producer David Eick on a powerful and dramatic update of the Galactica story.

Gone are the technobabble, disco-themed costumes and Egyptian helmets of the original series. The modern show introduces new elements to the Galactica story. The Cylons have developed human-form models that are indistinguishable from real humans. The Cylons have a monotheistic religion in contrast to the polytheistic religion of the human Colonies. The approach is serious and intense, with a focus on tough political, philosophical and religious issues set in a tale that manages to keep the focus on realistic and not always perfect characters.In the miniseries, the Cylons launch a massive attack against the humans and wipe out the Twelve Colonies, sending the 47,000 survivors on a desperate search for the fabled 13th colony -- Earth.


Season One Overview

The Cylons declare war on humanity, wiping out billions in an unprovoked first strike. The Colonial fleet is all but eliminated leaving just a handful of ships, including the soon to be decommissioned battlestar Galactica. Galactica is manned by a crew that never expected to be involved in real duty.  With the president gone and the government all but eliminated, Laura Roslin, the Education Minister, takes on the mantle of President of the 12 Colonies.

Gaius Baltar, a top researcher in Artificial Intelligence, inadvertently betrayed humanity by allowing a Cylon agent into the defense network, rendering it and all of the Colonial military forces impotent in the face of the Cylon attacks.  He sees her everywhere when no one else can. He initially attributes this to stress-induced hallucinations. She tells him that she implanted a chip in his brain during their time on Caprica, which enables her to talk to him. Over the season Baltar falls in love with the Cylon, Number Six, eventually betraying humanity again and again.

A lone soldier is trapped on Cylon-occupied Caprica, having given up his seat on a transport for Baltar, as he believes that his own life is not as important as one of the greatest minds of their time. He struggles against the odds, trying to stay alive amid the hostile Cylons. He is surprised to learn that Sharon Valerii, the pilot of the transport, returned for him. However, the truth is that she is actually another human-form Cylon. Sharon and Helo spend the season trying to escape Caprica. Sharon also finds herself falling in love with her human target. The season ends with her pregnant and fighting to save his life.

Meanwhile, the copy of Sharon onboard Galactica (known as ""Boomer"") has set off several bombs and engaged in other acts of sabotage. The season ends with a stunning turn of events after a successful mission to disable a Cylon base ship.

Awards and critical praise

The 2003 miniseries was the highest-rated miniseries on the Sci Fi Channel (soon to be known as Syfy) at the time. It was also the most successful cable miniseries that TV season.The first regular season premiered to excellent viewer numbers and critical acclaim. After the midseason break in Season Two, the show received widespread recognition from the mainstream media, including several outlets not always known for their interest in science fiction. As mentioned above, Time Magazine named BSG the best show on television for 2005. Rolling Stone Magazine and New York Newsday also named BSG the best show of the year. Many other publications like the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune lavished praise on the series.The American Film Institute added the show to its list of the ten best television shows of 2005. The show won Emmy Awards in the usual sci-fi categories of special visual effects but it also received Emmy nominations for writing and directing. It also won a prestigious Peabody award for its general excellence in creativity in the television medium.

The Sci Fi Channel has used creative means to promote the series, including the release of certain episodes as free streaming video on the official website. In the month leading up to the start of Season Three, the Sci Fi Channel aired a Web-only series titled Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance. The brief, 2 to 3 minute episodes revealed key events from the time period between the Season Two finale and the Season Three premiere episode. Another Web-only series was shown on the official website in the lead-up to the Season 4.5 ""final"" episodes.

A Battlestar Galactica television movie, ""Razor"", was broadcast in late 2007, followed soon after with a release on DVD. The story followed the struggles of Admiral Cain and young Kendra Shaw as they tried to survive the Cylon attack on the Colonies. The hard-hitting movie was well received by fans and critics.

Even though the series ""ended"" on March 20, 2009, with the two-hour broadcast of ""Daybreak, Part 2"", the Sci Fi Channel (Syfy) will broadcast one final Battlestar Galactica television movie. ""The Plan"" is scheduled to air in the fall of 2009.

The Galactica franchise will live on, even after the final movie and DVD. A prequel series, Caprica, began production even before Battlestar Galactica ended. The pilot movie will be released as a stand-alone DVD in April 2009. The movie will later air on Syfy along with regular episodes of the new series in 2010. For more information about this look at the early days of the development of the Cylons on Caprica, please consult the separate guide for that series.

Potter, Professor of Criminal Justice and Police Studies at Eastern Kentucky University, in writing about the savings and loan scandals of the 1980s, can also be used to illuminate some of the central premises of the show:""There is precious little difference between those people who society designates as respectable and law abiding and those people society castigates as hoodlums and thugs. The world of corporate finance and corporate capital is as criminogenic and probably more criminogenic than any poverty-wracked slum neighborhood. The distinctions drawn between business, politics, and organized crime are at best artificial and in reality irrelevant. Rather than being dysfunctions, corporate crime, white-collar crime, organized crime, and political corruption are mainstays of American political-economic life.""Tim Goodman, the television critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, summed the show up perfectly when he wrote: ""This show is precisely the reason you pay for HBO.""In New York's Newsday, Diane Werts says: ""Most TV crime series aspire to John Grisham's level. 'The Wire' aspires to Dostoevsky's.""Season ThemesSeason One centers around a family of drug dealers and the innerworkings of their empire.  It also follows the detectives who are trying to catch the high members of the empire.  Season Two steps away from the drug trade (while still mentioning characters from the previous season) to a case of dead prostitutes which turns into a look at the corruption surrounding the Port.  Season Three investigates politics and finishes the main stories that were left open in season one.  Season Four focuses on four middle school students and their journeys through the public school system and continues to address the politics of an inner-city and the issues of an election.  Season Five is rumored to be about the media's role in Baltimore.  Season Five will be the show's final season.Theme MusicIn the Season One opening credits, the Blind Boys of Alabama did Tom Waits's ""Way Down in the Hole"". The Season Two opening credits feature Waits's version of the song. According to creator David Simon, ""It was our way of saying: This is the same show (song) but this year, the tale itself (singer, tonality) will be different.""

1000301727,Everybody Hates Chris,2005-09-22,4.0,TV-PG,"Motivated by his childhood experiences, Emmy Award-winner/actor/comedian Chris Rock, narrates this very hilarious & touching story of a teenager growing up as the oldest of three children in Brooklyn, New York during the early 1980s.

Uprooted to a neighborhood and bused into a primarily white middle school two hours away by his strict, hard-working parents, Chris (played by Tyler James Williams) struggles to find his place, all while keeping his younger brother & sister in line at home and surmounting the tests of junior high school.  This dependable, resilient teen brings a unique, comedic spin to his everyday trials & upsets in UPN's new single-camera comedy, ""Everybody Hates Chris.""

The year that Chris turned 13 was 1982.  Filled with dreams that being a teenager would be really cool, Chris' entry into adolescence is turning out to be less pleasant.  Moved from the projects to the tough ""Bed-Stuy"" neighborhood of Brooklyn, Chris is still stuck in his big brother role.  As the family's ""emergency adult,"" he's accountable for taking care of his younger brother Drew (played by Tequan Richmond), and his younger sister Tonya (played by Imani Hakim) while his parents are working; Drew, although younger, is taller and more confident than Chris, while Tonya is the baby of the family, who gets all of the attention from his parents.

Chris' rough, cost-conscious father Julius (played by Terry Crews) works numerous jobs in order to properly support his family.  Meanwhile, his very strict, sassy mother Rochelle (played by Tichina Arnold), who works part-time in a small real estate office, runs the household on a very tight budget, while demanding the best for her children.

With his mother strong-minded to see him in a good school, Chris reluctantly faces multiple bus transfers each day to attend Corleone Junior High School in the fiercely Italian neighborhood, South Shore.  Although being an immediate target for bullies, Chris' innate charm and sharp wit enable him to make new friends at school, such as Greg (played by Vincent Martella), another smart, nice kid...who can't fight, by the way.

As Chris Rock pointedly looks back, his younger self is set to find what his family already knows: Chris' sharp, scrappy character is going to take him places.  But first, he's going to have to think, talk or run his way through one growing experience after another at both home and school, and on any number of buses along the way.

Revolving around the lives of freak and geek siblings Lindsay and Sam Weir (Linda Cardellini, John Daley), the show includes the everyday fears, humiliations and little triumphs of adolescents past, present and, no doubt, future,too. For sophomore Lindsay, life is getting difficult. Jolted by the death of her grandmother, she dons her dad's old Army jacket and fights the one-girl battle of McKinley High. The allure of being a champion ""mathlete"" is losing its appeal, and her goals of college and career feel somehow irrelevant. She's alienated. Luckily, though, she's not really alone. Drifting away from her studious friends, she finds herself increasingly drawn to others like her, the ""freaks"" who ' refuse to accept the status quo. Among them are Daniel (James Franco), a friendly but also a  dangerous guy who seems to like Lindsay, as does his bud Nick (Jason Segel), who dreams of stardom as a rock-and-roll drummer a la Led Zeppelin's Jon Bonham. Then there's Ken (Seth Rogen), an acerbic rebel, and Kim (Busy Philipps), a tough girl who doesn't go easy on Lindsay. Meanwhile, Lindsay's freshman brother Sam navigates high school like a mouse in a maze. Threatened at every turn, and attracted to an unattainable cheerleader, Sam faces his own set of obstacles. But he has good friends. Sure, they're ""geeks,"" but so is Sam. There's Neal (Samm Levine), a wise-acre, sci-fi loving geek, and bespectacled Bill (Martin Starr), a classic looking nerd who's unfortunately not as brainy as he appears. On the homefront, Lindsay and Sam suffer through the good intentions of their overbearing mom (Becky Ann Baker) and their hardwired dad Joe Flaherty), who turns every teen issue into a matter of life and death. Unfortunately the show was canceled after only 12 episodes had aired, this was due to the poor ratings obtained.

Although Malcolm has a genius IQ, he can't seem to make sense of the opposite sex, much less his embarrassing family. Lois (Jane Kaczmarek) is the outspoken, opinionated mom, who still manages to rule the roost even though her boys are growing wise to her crafty ways. Hal (Bryan Cranston), a dad who is just a bumbling, big kid at heart, often finds himself creating more chaos than his five boys combined. Reese (Justin Berfield) has mastered the art of a perfect blank stare, and makes up for his lack of intelligence with deviance.

Francis (Christopher Masterson), Malcolm's oldest and favorite brother, is willing to move from Alabama to Alaska to New Mexico – as long as its keeps him from moving back home. Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan), no longer the youngest, has learned his tricks from the best and often pulls the wool right over his brothers' eyes. And then there's Jamie, the newest member … and family scapegoat.

1000342025,Mr. Show with Bob and David,1995-11-03,4.0,TV-14,"Mr. Show was the insanely funny, critically loved but HBO-loathed sketch comedy that ran on the channel for 4 years from 1995-1998.

The show was created, executive produced, written and starred comics/writers Bob Odenkirk (The Ben Stiller Show) and David Cross (Arrested Development).  The show also starred Tom Kenny (SpongeBob SquarePants), Jill Talley and John Ennis.  Featured performers/writers included Paul F. Tompkins, Jerry Minor, B.J. Porter, Scott Aukerman, Brian Posehn (Just Shoot Me), and Jay Johnston.  Featured performers included Mary-Lynn Rajskub (24), Brett Paesal, and Sarah Silverman (Greg The Bunny).

The show has spawned a movie based on popular character Ronnie Dobbs in Run Ronnie Run.  After the show, the cast went on tour to colleges all over America and was wildly successfull.  All four seasons are now on DVD. Bob's wife, Naomi Odenkirk, has compiled everything you could ever want to know about the show in her wonderful book, Mr. Show: What Happened.  Bob and David have talked about a Mr. Show reunion, and possibly another movie (Hooray For America?). Bob, Jay, Jerry and John have appeared on David's show, Arrested Development.

The show has been called the only sketch show in America to ever be in the same league as Britain's Monty Python's Flying Circus.  The show is in the vein of Python in that sketches are ""linked"" together.  Some shows had themes, but many were just random pieces of wackiness thrown in your face like America had never seen (or may ever see) before.  Mr. Show may go down as the best sketch comedy in American TV History.  To think, it lasted only 30 episodes.

SYNDICATION
As of 2007, the show is not in syndication, but CMT Canada has announced they started airing the show September 8, 2006 at 8pm. It's not believed to be aired in the USA.
DVDs
As of 2008, there are no official DVDs available for the show. Judging from what we've heard, the reason for the delay in getting DVDs to the market is the music rights are expensive. The show used a lot of tracks from a large number of artists, and it would be very expensive for NBC to acquire the rights to use the music on the DVDs.",60.0,,87.0,32,Universal acclaim,83,17,Universal acclaim,False

With cast regulars Jeff Garlin (as manager Jeff Greene) and Cheryl Hines (as wife Cheryl), the series features appearances by guest celebrities playing themselves or character roles. Candid, unsparing and self-deprecating, Curb Your Enthusiasm brings the off-kilter comic vision of Larry David--co-creator and co-executive producer of one of the most lauded comedy series in TV history, Seinfeld--to HBO. The series blurs the lines between reality and fiction, as David (playing himself) and a cast of real and fictional characters are followed around Los Angeles by a ubiquitous camera that chronicles the private, often banal world of a (relatively) public man. Having evolved from the 1999 HBO special Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, this series proves how seemingly trivial details of one's day-to-day life--a trip to the movies, a phone call, a visit from some trick-or-treaters--can precipitate a ""Murphy's Law"" chain of misfortune to hilarious effect. Like George Costanza in Seinfeld, the protagonist of Curb Your Enthusiasm has a knack for getting himself into uncomfortable situations that end up alienating him from peers and acquaintances. To keep the narrative fresh and spontaneous, Curb Your Enthusiasm is shot without a script; the cast is given scene outlines and often improvise lines as they go. The result is an unpredictable format that's unlike anything else on TV.
In Germany the show is known as Lass es, Larry! (""Stop it, Larry!"")In Portuguese the show is known as A Louca Vida de Larry (""Larry's Crazy Life"")In Norway it is known is Ingen grunn til begeistringIn Sweden it is known as Simma lugnt, Larry!In Finland it is known as JÃ¤itÃ¤ hattuun",30.0,Deep inside you know you're him.,84.0,130,Universal acclaim,85,737,Universal acclaim,False
1000300043,Seinfeld,1989-07-05,9.0,TV-PG,"This is a show about nothing; however, for a show about nothing, this show has many complex plots, sub-plots, is very well written and put together. So much so that until the public caught onto the series, the television critics were responsible for helping to keep it alive. The critics further went on and made the series victorious in every category it was eligible for in the 1st Annual American Television Awards. Seinfeld has also won a few Emmy Awards, the George Foster Peabody Award for 1992 and many more. Many of the early episodes were based on the life experiences of series co-creator, Larry David. Stories such as The Stock Tip and The Jacket really happened, as did many others. Across the hall from Larry lived a man named Kenny Kramer, who aside from the physical comedy aspects, lives the life of TV Kramer. Find out all about him at the real Kramer's web site. Some aspects were based on Jerry's life. Jerry's real address in NYC when he was struggling comic was 129 W. 81 St., this is the address used for his building in the series. In the series, Jerry lives in apartment 5A, Kramer in 5B. Viewer Jason Dean Vaupel notes that in a couple of episodes of the second season, Jerry lives in apartment 3A. And Newman's apartment has usually been 5E, but viewer Jeff Holland notes that it sometimes is 5F and that 5E was rented out to someone else as already noted in the episode, The Conversion. Their building is called The Shelley according to viewer Kipp Teague whose discerned that from the awning on the building. However, that building is actually located in Los Angeles, the building at the real address in NYC is much different. Jeff Holland also notes that The Shelley has no visible fire escapes, but there is one outside of Jerry's window. Other aspects are composite of both lives. For example, Elaine's character is half based on Jerry's ex-girlfriend Carol Leifer. Carol joined the production staff in the 5th season. An ex-girlfriend of Larry David's, named Monica Yates, whose father was a noted writer in the other half of the Elaine equation. Larry David once wore a suede jacket that got wet while meeting her father. Another viewer, Bobby Bank, notes that a tribute to Jerry's father is seen in occasional episodes. Jerry's father, named Kal, worked in the sign business, so occasionally in the background you may see a sign that says Kal's Signs. Bobby stated in a trade magazine for the sign industry called Signs of the Times that he... Quote:
had the pleasure of meeting and working with Kal in the early 70s when we were producing Jewelite (Bobby's company) letters for him. I remember Kal saying, 'Bobby, you should meet my son Jerry. He's a real funny guy.'

Viewer Robert Buchanan also reminds me that it is ironic that Jerry's father's name is Kal, and Superman's real Kryptonian name is Kal-El.

Most every episode takes place in Jerry's apartment; however, there are (of course) a few exceptions: The Chinese Restaurant, The Pen, The Parking Garage, The Subway, The Limo, The Airport, The Movie, The Hamptons, The Merv Griffin Show & The Dealership. While no activity occurs there, an empty apartment is shown in The Puerto Rican Day.

1000300568,The Kids in the Hall,1988-10-16,5.0,TV-PG,"Get ready for sketch comedy...Canadian style!

The Kids In The Hall are a hilarious sketch comedy troupe.  They got their name from a comedian named Jack Benny, who would often end a joke by saying: ""I got this from the kids in the hall"", referring to the amateur comedians who would hang around outside his office.  KITH was formed in 1984 when McCulloch and McKinney, who had worked together in Calgary as part of a group named the Audience, teamed up with Foley and McDonald's Toronto-based group, KITH. Thompson officially joined in January 1985. 

That same year, McCulloch and McKinney were hired as writers for NBC's Saturday Night Live after a talent scout saw KITH in performance. Significantly, SNL had also been created by Michaels, himself an ex-patriate Canadian living and producing in New York. Still in 1985, Foley appeared in the film High Stakes, and Thompson and McDonald toured with Second City. In 1986, KITH were reunited in Toronto and Michaels finally saw them perform. He immediately envisaged a television project around them. In 1987, he moved KITH to New York and, paying each member $150 per week, had them perform in comedy clubs, write new material, and rehearse sketches. In 1988, Michaels produced their HBO special. The regular series followed.  The TV show lasted between 1989-1994 for 5 seasons on the CBC in Canada and on HBO and CBS in the U.S.  After the TV show, the Kids went on to different projects, one movie, and 2 tours.  One in 2000, and one in 2002.

The potential images those words created alone caused more controversy for this series, before it had even premiered.  The ""Bible Belt"" was up in arms and no-one had even seen an episode.  In most of those southern states the local ABC affiliates refused to carry the show, which was a shame because aside from a ""little"" bare flesh and a couple of harsh words, they missed out on a quality television show. Of course it wasn't long before they realized it really was no big deal.

Late during the first season, Steven Bochco said during an acceptance speech at the 20th Annual People's Choice Awards:

""In spite of those who seek to legislate what we can and cannot see on our own television sets in the privacy of our own homes. NYPD Blue has succeeded because the American people, properly so, prefer to judge for themselves.""

At those awards the show was voted ""favorite new television dramatic series"" and ""favorite television dramatic series"" the first year it was eligible.  The show has been nominated for and won numerous awards.  Check out this IMDb link for more information.  Most notably the series has been nominated for an Emmy 84 times and has won 20 of those times and Dennis Franz has claim to four of those statues.

Before this series, some of the stars had an affiliation with Steven Bochco from his previous highly acclaimed series Hill Street Blues.  David Caruso had guest starred in two episodes and during the 3rd season, Dennis Franz guest starred as Det. Sal Benedetto in 5 episodes and was killed off in his last appearance.  Franz officially joined the cast in that show's 6th season as Lt. Norman Buntz and stayed with the show until it ended.  Then the Buntz character was brought back for a short-lived comedy series called Beverly Hills Buntz the following season.  This series didn't last because it was erratically scheduled as a fill-in and then couldn't build an audience.  James McDaniel also appeared in a Hill Street Blues episode and then also appeared in Steven Bochco's attempt at something new, a musical police drama called Cop Rock.  When Caruso left early on in the series, another Bochco veteran was called upon; Jimmy Smits who played Victor Sifuentes on Bochco's L.A. Law was brought in to play new detective Bobby Simone.

While other actors have left with big screen ambitions, two actors have left the series to move onto other Bochco created programs.  In 1996 there was an attempt to launch a comedy that featured as one of the characters in the ensemble PAA John Irvin played by Bill Brochtrup.  Public Morals only aired one episode and was pulled.  I would hesitate to call it a spin-off, since only one (at that time) minor character from this series appeared on it, but I suppose an argument could be made.  After all, Dennis Franz did take his Norman Buntz character from Hill Street Blues to Beverly Hills Buntz, a comedy series that lasted much longer than Public Morals did.  Bill Brochtrup returned back to the 15th and made several guest appearances before becoming a full cast member in the 6th season.   In 2001 Kim Delaney left this series (with a loophole that would allow her to come back) to star in Philly.  That series wasn't too long lived and Det. Russell has subsequently returned for a guest spot or two.

While this cast has undergone a rotation of lead actors, Dennis Franz was the glue that held this series together.

Most of the show's run was at Tuesdays at 10pm ET on ABC.  The show was simulcast in HDTV. With the 2000-2001 TV season, the show became ABC's first regularly scheduled entertainment series to be broadcast in high definition.

Together, with my stalwart sidekick, Arthur, and the magnanimous help of some other folks I know, we form the yin to villainy's malevolent yang. Destiny has chosen us. Wicked men! You face...The Tick!""

The life of a superhero is not easy. There are not enough dangers. However, someone must fight evil and protect good. The few who face this challenge have to leave behind comfort, security and a little sanity. Jumping from roof to roof in one single jump, the mysterious blue justice defender The Tick (Patrick Warburton) patrols The City, and his limited knowledge of human life doesn't interfere with his desire to protect society. The frustrated and well-behaved accountant known as Arthur (David Burke) left his job to join The Tick as The Moth, and now they're a crime-fighting duo. Arthur has always secretly wished being a superhero. Well, not so secretly, since he used his moth outfit (which looks more like a bunny) to work. On this fight against injustice, The Tick also counts on Batmanuel (Nestor Carbonell), a Latino superhero who never promotes himself without a worthy cause. His kryptonite is Captain Liberty (Liz Vassey), the government's number one weapon on the battle against supervillains.

The Tick is based on the 'cult' comic character created by Ben Edlund. There was an animated version a few years ago. Check it out here.

Originally planned as a 2000-2001 midseason replacement after The Simpsons on Sunday nights, and apparently never thought of as anything more than strike filler for a writer's strike which never happened, FOX toppers Sandy Grushow and Gail Berman changed their minds, keeping Malcolm in the Middle in the slot for another year and pushing The Tick back to fall. When The Tick finally went on the air, it was dumped on Thursdays.

The twice-divorced doctor's peaceful home life of fine cigars and haute cuisine was shattered when his gruff, ex-cop father, Martin, was injured in the line of duty and forced to move in with Frasier. Martin brought with him a semi-psychic, live-in home-care provider, Daphne Moon, his pesky Jack Russell terrier, Eddie, and a duct-taped recliner that clashes with Frasier's more aesthetically pleasing Eames and Wassily chairs. Their home is frequently visited by Frasier's snobbish and competitive brother, Niles, a fellow psychiatrist whose longtime romantic interest in Daphne was finally happily realized at the conclusion of Season 7. At work, his slightly jaded producer and man-hungry single parent Roz Doyle, supports Frasier. Some of the people who voice the callers to Frasier's radio program are often bigtime celebrities.

""Frasier"", starring Kelsey Grammer in his Emmy Award-winning title role of Dr. Frasier Crane, made history by becoming the first series, comedy or drama, to achieve a record five consecutive Emmy wins for Outstanding Comedy Series. With this achievement, the series stands ahead of ""Cheers"", the series from which ""Frasier"" was spun-off. Overall, ""Frasier"" earned a total of 37 Emmys (more than any other series in history), including four for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Kelsey Grammer and four for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for David Hyde Pierce. It's also interesting to point out that Kelsey Grammer played the part of Frasier for 20 years, tying him for the longest duration playing the same character on television and, that the show included guest appearances from almost all regulars from ""Cheers"", excluding Kirstie Alley.

A tough but soft-hearted police detective in Arcadia, Will Girardi (Joe Mantegna) dreams of providing a safe haven for his family and community. An outbreak of serious crime in his idyllic new town has challenged Girardi's desire for order, as have the ups and downs he faces with his family. Daughter Joan (Amber Tamblyn), an average teenager, has been acting a little strange. Most don't know that it has to do with the unusual way various people keep popping up, introducing themselves as God and then giving her specific directions to do things, such as get a job, join the debate team or volunteer with children. The appearances are hard for her to believe, even more so as she never knows who's going to turn up next. One minute it's a cute boy her own age, the next it's the lunch lady or a little girl. She'd been keeping it a secret from everyone, though she has finally revealed it to her artistic and generally sensitive boyfriend, Adam (Christopher Marquette), who believes she's been experiencing hallucinations.

Rounding out the Girardi family are her art-teacher mother, Helen (Mary Steenburgen); her 16-year-old science-geek brother, Luke (Michael Welch), and her older, newspaper-writer brother, Kevin (Jason Ritter), a former high-school sports star who is in a wheelchair as a result of a car accident. Joan's unlikely new best friend is her publicly caustic and rebellious, but privately insightful and supportive classmate, Grace (Becky Wahlstrom). Unsure of what God wants--if God exists--and if she's even sane, Joan tentatively follows God's cryptic directives, all the while trying to retain a normal teenaged existence. Theme Song:

(Jeffrey Tambor), is sent to prison for shifty accounting practices.  While George Sr. spent the last year in the slammer discovering his newfound Judaism and recording inspirational tapes, Michael spent it picking up the pieces and trying to teach his offbeat family how to live without an endless expense account.

1000300003,Taxi,1978-09-12,5.0,TV-PG,"Taxi's television history is filled with contradictions. Produced by some of television comedy's most well-regarded talent, the show was canceled by two different networks. Despite winning fourteen Emmy Awards in only five seasons, the program's ratings were rock-bottom for its final seasons. Although it thrives in syndication and is still well-loved by many viewers, Taxi will be best remembered as the ancestral bridge between two of the most successful sit-coms of all time: The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Cheers. 

In the mid-1970s, MTM Productions had achieved huge success with both popularity and critical appraisal. So it was an unexpected move when four of the company's finest writers and producers, James L. Brooks, Stan Daniels, David Davis, and Ed. Weinberger, jumped off the stable ship of MTM in 1978 to form their own production company, John Charles Walters Company. To launch their new venture, they looked back to an idea that Brooks and Davis had previously considered with MTM: the daily life of a New York City taxi company. From MTM head Grant Tinker they purchased the rights to the newspaper article that had initiated the concept and began producing this new show at Paramount for ABC. They brought a few other MTM veterans along for the ride, including director James Burrows and writer/producers Glen and Les Charles. 

Although Taxi certainly bore many of the trademark signs of ""quality television"" as exemplified by MTM, other changes in style and focus distinguished this from an MTM product. After working on the middle-class female-centered worlds of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, and Phyllis for years, the group at John Charles Walters wanted to create a program focusing on blue-collar male experience. MTM programs all had clearly defined settings, but Taxi's creators wanted a show that was firmly rooted in a city's identity--Taxi's situations and mood were distinctly New York. Despite MTM Productions innovations in creating ensemble character comedy, there was always one central star around which the ensemble revolved. In Taxi Judd Hirsch's Alex Reiger was a main character, but his importance seemed secondary to the centrality of the ensemble and the Sunshine Cab Company itself. While The Mary Tyler Moore Show proudly proclaimed that ""you're going to make it on your own,"" the destitute drivers of Taxi were doomed to perpetual failure; the closest any of them came to happiness was Reiger's content acceptance of his lot in life--to be a cabby. 

Taxi debuted on 12 September 1978, amidst a strong ABC Tuesday night line-up. It followed Three's Company, a wildly-successful example of the type of show MTM ""quality"" sit-coms reacted against. Taxi used this strong position to end the season ninth in the ratings and garner its first of three straight Emmys for Outstanding Comedy Series. The show's success was due to its excellent writing, Burrows's award-winning directing using his innovative four-camera technique, and its largely unknown but talented cast. Danny DeVito's Louie DePalma soon became one of the most despised men on television--possibly the most unredeemable and worthless louse of a character ever to reside on the small screen. Andy Kaufman's foreign mechanic Latka Gravas provided over-the-top comedy within an ensemble emphasizing subtle character humor. But Kaufman sometimes also brought a demonic edge to the character, an echo of his infamous appearances on Saturday Night Live as a macho wrestler of women and Mighty Mouse lip-syncher. In the second season Christopher Lloyd's Reverend Jim Ignatowski was added to the group as television's first drugged-out '60s burn-out character. But Lloyd's Emmy-winning performance created in Jim more than just a storehouse of fried brain cells; he established a deep, complex humanity that moved far beyond mere caricature. The program launched successful movie careers for DeVito and Lloyd, as well as the fairly-notable television careers of Tony Danza and Marilu Henner; Kaufman's controversial career would certainly have continued had he not died of cancer in 1984.

In its third season ABC moved Taxi from beneath Three's Company's protective wing to a more competitive Wednesday night slot; the ratings plummeted and Taxi finished the next two years in 53rd place. ABC canceled the show in early 1982 as part of a larger network push away from ""quality"" and toward the Aaron Spelling-produced popular fare of Dynasty and The Love Boat. HBO bid for the show, looking for it to become the first ongoing sitcom for the pay channel, but lost out to NBC, which scheduled the series for the 1982-83 season. Ironically, this reunited the show's executive producers with their former boss Tinker, who had taken over NBC. Tinker's reign at NBC was focused, not surprisingly, on ""quality"" programming which he hoped would attract viewers to the perennially last-place network. Taxi was partnered with a very compatible show on Thursday night--Cheers, created by Taxi veterans Charles, Burrows, and Charles. Although this line-up featured some of the great programs in television history--the comedies were sandwiched by dramas Fame and Hill St. Blues--the ratings were dreadful and Taxi finished the season in 73rd place. NBC was willing to stick by Cheers for another chance, but felt Taxi had run its course and canceled it at the end of the season. Had Taxi been given another year or two, it would have been part of one of the most successful nights on television, featuring The Cosby Show (co-created by Taxi creator Weinberger), Family Ties, Hill St. Blues, L.A. Law, and eventual powerhouse Cheers. 

Taxi lives on in syndication, but its most significant place in television history is as the middle generation between The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Cheers. It served as a transition between the star-driven middle-class character comedy of MTM programs and the location-centered ensemble comedy inhabited by the losers of Cheers and Taxi. Considered one of the great sit-coms of its era, Taxi stands as a prime example of the constant tension in television programming between standards of ""quality"" and reliance on high ratings to determine success.

Stottlemeyer, who wavered between admiration for Monk and annoyance at his eccentricities during the first season, becomes more of a friend to Monk as the series develops, frequently calling him in to help, as much for Monk's benefit as for his own.

The sole responsibility of the special task force is to find missing persons by applying advanced psychological profiling techniques to peel back the layers of the victims' lives and trace their whereabouts in an effort to discover whether they have been abducted, been murdered, committed suicide or simply run away. The team reconstructs a ""Day of Disappearance"" timeline that details every minute of the 24 hours prior to the disappearance, following one simple rule: learn who the victim is in order to learn where the victim is. Senior agent Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia) heads the dedicated team that knows too well that every second counts when someone vanishes. His squad includes Samantha Spade (Poppy Montgomery), an agent who doesn't let her good looks get in the way of being tough; Vivian Johnson (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a no-nonsense investigator; Danny Taylor (Enrique Murciano), an intense and private agent; and Martin Fitzgerald (Eric Close), the newest member of the team, considered a lightweight by the squad because his only experience involves fighting white-collar crime.

In six seasons, much has happened. Martin Fitzgerald is no longer considered the lightweight he once was, having earned the respect of the team through his solid work. Jack Malone has been through many ups and downs and now finds himself in a bad position following the mishandling of a case. Vivian Johnson has proven herself, and a new agent has been welcomed into the ranks -- Elena Delgado (Roselyn Sánchez), a Hispanic female agent who came on in the program's fourth season as the squad faced ever-increasing demands on its time and resources. A former member of the NYPD, she is already known to Danny and their connection grows as the series progresses.

1000300104,The Practice,1997-03-04,8.0,TV-14,"David E. Kelley's Emmy Award-winning legal drama, The Practice, had eight amazing seasons, with promising, provocative, issue-related stories, coupled with the writer's trademark humor.

Set in Boston, The Practice centers on a firm of passionate attorneys to whom every case is important and every client worth a fight to the end. Legal maneuvering is the firm's modus operandi, and they have it down to a science, making even the most questionable arguments convincing. And while they can't - and don't - win every trial, the pursuit of justice remains the priority until the final verdict is announced … and sometimes afterwards. Pursuing justice, however, often confronts them with serious ethical and moral issues of conscience. The end of last season saw Bobby Donnell quitting the firm and leaving Eugene Young (Steve Harris) in charge. In the final season, we find Eugene not only tackling his new role as head of the firm, but also the new dynamic with co-workers Ellenor Frutt (Camryn Manheim), a single mom known for her fervent commitment to clients and for refusing to take ""no"" for an answer; Jimmy Berluti (Michael Badalucco), a hard-working ""good guy"" with a winning record and unparalleled loyalty to the firm; and a budding relationship with Jamie Stringer (Jessica Capshaw), a young associate recently out of law school. In addition to returning cast members Manheim, Harris, Badalucco and Capshaw, in the final season,  Kelley injected the series with intriguing new characters, including acclaimed film actor James Spader, who will play Alan Shore, a complicated and ethically challenged lawyer, and Rhona Mitra, who will play Tara Wilson, a confident paralegal in her third year of law school who is also the firm's new tough-as-nails assistant.

The multiple Emmy Award-winning drama has also earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Drama Series, a Peabody Award, a Viewers for Quality Television Award, an American Bar Association Silver Gavel Award and, most recently, a coveted Humanitas Award.

1000300304,Murphy Brown,1988-11-14,11.0,TV-PG,"Murphy Brown was created by Diane English. Murphy is the star reporter on a news magazine show called FYI. The show is based in Washington DC, which gives the FYI team more than enough material to work with. Murphy lives in a townhouse that she has been having repainted for the duration of the series, Eldin the painter may never finish the job, but Murphy doesn't seem to mind. Murphy owes her Betty Ford trip to Phil, he owns the local bar & restaurant where the staff and the rest of the political scene have lunch. Phil knows about everything going on in Washington. Jim Dial is the uptight senior anchor, a seasoned veteran, who accompanied Murphy on her trip to the Betty Ford Clinic. Frank is a single guy and constantly looking for a girlfriend, he is also Murphy's best friend. Corky is a former Miss America turned news person, she covers all the ""hard"" news. Miles is a young Harvard graduate, whose first ""real job"" out of school is as executive producer of FYI. 

Murphy has trouble keeping a secretary, in this guide the actors that play this small part has their appearance number placed after their names, take note of the increasing number after the character name of Secretary. Some secretaries had no dialog and did not get credited, others wound up on the cutting room floor, this accounts for holes in the numbering scheme. When Murphy became a new mother, she began to run through nannies the same way, they are also numbered after the character name of Nanny. After running through 6 of them, she makes the obvious choice for a nanny, Eldin, who prefers the term ""Big Guy."" It also takes Murphy four months to give the baby his name. 

After nine seasons in the newsroom, the series looked like it might take a different direction in the 10th season. Murphy may change careers and become a White House senior advisor. Amazing since in the past she had been banned from the White House press room on several occassions. True to form, when she does, it is only for a short time. When a commercial for the series aired during the 49th Annual Prime Time Emmy Awards, it seemed to indicate that Murphy's life would take a different turn. It certainly does when she faces her own mortality when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. 

Murphy Brown has done well with the Prime Time Emmy Awards with nominations in many categories and numerous awards for Candice Bergen as ""Best Actress in a Comedy Series."" So many in fact that she declined the nomination for 1996, allowing Helen Hunt to get the Emmy that Candice thought she deserved a few years earlier.

1000300086,Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,1993-09-12,4.0,TV-PG,"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman was a phenomenal television success. A much more lavish version of the popular Superman television series which had first aired forty years earlier, Lois & Clark focused more on the Man of Steel's early adult years in Metropolis.

With the unknowing help of Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher), Clark Kent (Dean Cain) created Superman there in Metropolis after finding work at the world-famous Daily Planet newspaper, where he meets fellow reporter Lois Lane. After Superman's debut, Lois becomes infatuated with Superman and continues to reject Clark's romantic overtures due to past bad experiences with men.

The rest of the first season Daily Planet staff includes Perry White, the chief editor, society columnist Catherine Grant (Tracy Scoggins), and cub reporter/photographer Jimmy Olsen (Michael Landes/Justin Whalin). Other major characters in the series include archvillain Lex Luthor (John Shea) and Superman's adoptive parents, Martha (K Callan) and Jonathan Kent (Eddie Jones). In a salute to the original Superman series, Phyllis Coates guest starred as Lois's mother, Ellen Lane in the last episode of the season. Coates had, of course, been the original Lois in the first Superman series.

Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman began to play up the romantic aspects of the series as the season progressed. By the end of the second season Lois had finally realised that Clark Kent and Superman were the same person so it came as no surprise to her when he finally revealed his true identity and proposed marriage.

Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman went where few shows care to go - it allowed the relationship between the two title characters to grow and develop naturally, as it might in real life. The real ratings problems began in the third season, when the network insisted on a fake wedding. Nicknamed the ""ARRGGGHH"" by the fans, the non-wedding arc included a clone, a kidnapping, and even amnesia. It would have been bearable if the famous couple had ended up together, but the network, afraid of the Remington Steel curse, refused to allow it, which set up some interesting season rewrites, because the original intent was to allow the marriage to occur.

Lois & Clark ended in 1997 with a cliffhanger, canceled by a network that did its best to bury the successful series in order to bring back The Wonderful World Of Disney.  By the end of the last season, Lois and Clark had come a long way from the prickly, anything for a story, but marshmallow-hearted woman and the naive farm boy from Kansas. The Ice Queen had softened, the farm boy had grown up. Both had fallen in love, married, and were discussing children.

The last episode was unsatisfying due to its lack of a conclusion, but the series is still popular today.  Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman left a lasting mark on the face of a mythos where Clark Kent was real, Superman was the disguise, and Lois Lane was essential to his make-up.

This drama is set in a south Florida plastic surgery center, McNamara-Troy, centering around the two doctors who own it. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) is having problems at home, trying to keep his family together, trying to patch up the rocky road him and his wife Julia (Joely Richardson) are experiencing. On the other hand, sex-craved Christian Troy (Julian McMahon) uses his charm to bring in potential female candidates and conducts shady business deals, often for the love of money. While Sean takes his job seriously, he often has to fix Christian's mistakes. During the first season, Sean and Christian got mixed up with Escobar Gallardo, a Colombian drug lord who forced the two to do free surgery whenever he wanted them to. Sean's marriage with Julia began to wear thin, and Sean had an affair with a patient named Megan O'Hara. Julia went back to school, but it was interrupted by a miscarriage of a child Sean and Julia were trying to have. Christian learned he is the father of a baby with a woman named Gina, who he met at Sexaholics Anonymous. When the baby was born, we learn that the baby is African-American, and therefore not his. Julia questions Matt's paternity.

The second season begins with Sean and Christian both turning 40, and Christian playing father for Wilbur, who Gina is letting him take care of, until Wilbur's real father fights him for custody. Sean and Julia are quite happy together again until Christian's loneliness after Wilbur was taken away from him causes her to reveal that Matt is really his son. The secret ripples and eventually Sean finds out, causing a separation between Sean and Julia. He and Christian find a way to stay friends. A serial rapist named the Carver has been raping victims around Miami, and slices their face, and Sean makes a commitment to fixing their faces. Ava, a life coach for Sean and Julia, forms a sexual relationship with Matt, which is doomed from the beginning due to a wide age gap and Ava's screwed up son Adrian.

Seasons three and four have been ordered by FX at 15 episodes each. Season 3 will begin production in June for a September premiere date. Chronological repeats of the show air Sundays at 10pm.

1000300048,M*A*S*H,1972-09-17,11.0,TV-PG,"M*A*S*H was a true ensemble series. Whilst characters such as Kellye, Igor, Rizzo, Goldman and Ginger are listed where they appear as specific characters central to the plot, they also appeared regularly as non-speaking cast members. This is also true of many of the nurses, corpsmen, orderlies and drivers listed as guest stars.

Based on the 1968 novel by Richard Hooker and the 1970 20th Century-Fox movie of the same name, M*A*S*H aired on CBS from September 17, 1972 to February 21st, 1983 for 251 episodes, and has become one of the most celebrated television series in the history of the medium. During its initial season, however, M*A*S*H was in danger of being canceled due to low ratings. The show reached the top ten program list the following year, and never fell out of the top twenty rated programs during the remainder of its run. The final episode of M*A*S*H was a two and one half hour special that attracted the largest audience to ever view a single television program episode. In many ways the series set the standard for some of the best programming to appear later. The show used multiple plot lines in a half-hour episodes, usually with at least one story in the comedic vein and another dramatic. Some later versions of this form, e.g. Hooperman (ABC 1987-1989) and The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd (NBC 1987-1989), would be known as the dramady, half-hour programs incorporating elements of both comedy and drama. Other comedies would forgo the more serious aspects of M*A*S*H, but maintain its focus on character and motive. And some dramatic programming, such as St. Elsewhere and Moonlighting would draw on the mixture of elements to distinguish themselves from more conventional television. M*A*S*H was set in South Korea, near Seoul, during the Korean War. The series focused on the group of doctors and nurses whose job was to heal the wounded who arrived at this ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital"" by helicopter, ambulance or bus. The hospital compound was isolated from the rest of the world. One road ran through the camp; a mountain blocked one perimeter and a minefield the other. Here the wounded were patched up and sent home--or back to the front. Here, too, the loyal audience came to know and respond to an exceptional ensemble cast of characters. The original cast assumed roles created in Altman's movie. The protagonists were Dr. Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce(Alan Alda) and Dr. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers). Pierce and McIntyre were excellent surgeons who preferred to chase female nurses and drink homemade gin to operating and who had little, if any use for military discipline or authority. As a result, they often ran afoul of two other medical officers, staunch military types, Dr. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and Senior Nurse, Major Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit). The camp commander, Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), was a genial bumbler whose energies were often directed toward preventing Burns and Houlihan from court martialing Pierce and McIntyre. The camp was actually run by Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), the company clerk who could spontaneously finish Blake's unspoken sentences and hear incoming helicopters before they were audible to other human ears. Other regulars were Corporal Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) who, in the early seasons, usually dressed in women's clothing in an ongoing attempt to secure a medical (mental) discharge, and Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher), the kindly camp priest who looked out for an orphanage.

In the course of its eleven years the series experienced many cast changes. McIntyre was ""discharged"" after the 1974-75 season because of a contract dispute between the producers and Rogers. He was replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell), a clean cut family man quite different from Pierce's lecherous doctor. Frank Burns was given a psychiatric discharge in the beginning of the 1977-78 season and was replaced by Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers), a Boston blueblood who disdained the condition of the camp and tent mates Pierce and Hunnicutt. O'Reilly's departure at the beginning of the 1979-80 season was explained by the death of his fictional uncle, and Klinger took over the company clerk position. Perhaps the most significant change for the group occurred with the leave-taking of Henry Blake. His exit was written into the series in tragic fashion. As his plane was flying home over the Sea of Japan it was shot down and the character killed. Despite the ""realism"" of this narrative development, public sentiment toward the event was so negative that the producers promised never to have another character depart the same way. Colonel Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan), a doctor with a regular Army experience in the cavalry, replaced Blake as camp commander and became more both more complex and more involved with the other characters than Blake had been. Though the series was set in Korea, M*A*S*H, both the movie and the series, was initially developed as a critique of the Vietnam War. As that war dragged toward conclusion, however, the series focused more on characters than situations--a major development for situation comedy. Characters were given room to learn from their mistakes, to adapt and change. Houlihan became less the rigid military nurse and more a friend to both her subordinates and the doctors. Pierce changed from a gin-guzzling skirt chaser to a more ""enlightened"" male who cares about women and their issues, a reflection of Alda himself. O'Reilly outgrew his youthful innocence, and Klinger gave up his skirts and wedding dresses to assume more authority. This focus on character rather than character type set M*A*S*H apart from other comedies of the day and the style of the show departed from the norm in many other ways as well, both in terms of its style and its mode of production. While most other contemporary sitcoms took place indoors and were largely produced on videotape in front of a live audience, M*A*S*H was shot on film on location in Southern California, as well as in a closed studio set (studio #9 at 20th Century Fox). Outdoor shooting at times presented problems. While shooting the final episode, for example, forest fires destroyed the set, causing a delay in filming. The series also made innovative uses of the laugh track. In early seasons, the laugh track was employed during the entire episode. As the series developed, the laugh track was removed from scenes that occurred in the operating room. In a few episodes, the laugh track was removed entirely, another departure from sitcom conventions. The most striking technical aspect of the series is found in its aggressively cinematic visual style. Instead of relying on straight cuts and short takes episodes often used long shots with people and vehicles moving between the characters and the camera. Tracking shots moved with action, and changed direction when the story was ""handed off"" from one group of characters to another. These and other camera movements, wedded to complex editing techniques, enabled the series to explore character psychology in powerful ways, and to assert the preeminence of the ensemble over any single individual. In this way M*A*S*H seemed to be asserting the central fact of war, that individual human beings are caught in the tangled mesh of other lives and there must struggle to retain some sense of humanity and compassion. This approach was grounded in Altman's film style and enabled M*A*S*H to manipulate its multiple story lines and its mixture of comedy and drama with techniques that matched the complex, absurd tragedy of war itself. M*A*S*H was one of the most innovative sitcoms of the 1970s and 1980s. Its stylistic flair and narrative mix drew critical acclaim, while the solid writing and vitally drawn characters helped the series maintain high ratings. The show also made stars of it performers, none more so than Alda, who went on to a successful career in film. The popularity of M*A*S*H was quite evident in the 1978-79 season. CBS aired new episodes during primetime on Monday and programmed reruns of the series in the daytime and on Thursday late night, giving the show a remarkable seven appearances on a single network in a five day period. The series produced one unsuccessful spin-off, AfterMASH, which aired on CBS from 1983-85. The true popularity of M*A*S*H can still be seen, for the series is one of the most widely syndicated series throughout the world. Despite the historical setting, the characters and issues in this series remain fresh, funny and compelling in ways that continue to stand as excellent television.

M*A*S*H Theme Song - ""Suicide Is Painless""
Written by Digital Tradition Mirror
(Lyrics shortened for television theme)

Through early morning fog I see,
Visions of the things to be,
The pains that are withheld for me,
I realize and I can see...

That suicide is painless,
It brings on many changes,
And I can take or leave it if I please.

With a big part of personal intimacy, which Paul Reiser, the head character and the creator of the show, compares to ""a ride home after a party, when a couple can finally tell each other what have they been thinking all night"", the 30-minute show searches for capricious moments of every couple.

1000300590,Beavis and Butt-head,1993-03-01,9.0,TV-14,"Beavis and Butt-head was first aired on the U.S. cable network MTV in March 1993. This show, which combined animation and music videos, was an example of the unique programming that MTV has consistently provided for its youthful demographics. The half-hour program alternated between a simple narrative, which focused on the exploits of two low-life adolescents, and clips from music videos, which the two teens commented on. Creator Mike Judge had penned the aimless duo for a festival of animation when Abby Turkuhle, MTV's senior vice president picked up an episode for the network's animated compendium Liquid Television. MTV immediately contracted for 65 episodes from Judge, with Turkuhle as producer, and placed Beavis and Butt-head in the 7:00 and 11:00 P.M. week-day time slots.

The characters, Beavis and Butt-head, are rude, crude, and stupid, and can be placed in the ""dumb comedy"" tradition, which includes Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Cheech and Chong, Saturday Night Live's Wayne and Garth, and FOX's The Simpsons. When the show debuted, television critics differed in their opinions, with some praising the show for daring to present the stupidity of male ""metalheads"" who watch too much television (effectively satirizing the core MTV audience), and others categorizing Beavis and Butt-head as another example of television's declining quality. Beavis and Butt-head did find an audience and began pulling in MTV's highest ratings. But the show was also quite controversial, instigating heated public debate on the interconnected issues of representations of violence in the media and generational politics surrounding youth subcultures.

Beavis and Butt-head they found, was especially popular with those in their twenties. It turned out to be bothersome to many that young people enjoyed the show and laughed at its two imbecilic boys, even if these fans were much more intelligent and much less grating than Beavis and Butt-head. In this sense, Beavis and Butt-head raised the issue of generational taste cultures. Definitions of ""taste,"" Pierre Bourdieu notes, ""unite and separate, uniting those who are the product of similar conditions but only by distinguishing them from all others. And taste distinguishes in an essential way, since it is the basis of all that one has--people and things--and of all that one is for others, whereby one classifies oneself and is classified by others."" To the degree that taste cultures agree, they are brought together into a subcultural formation; but to this degree they are also separated from those with whom they differ. It was the ""bad taste"" of Beavis and Butt-head's audience which bothered many, and this brings to the surface another one of the reasons why Beavis and Butt-head was so controversial.

Cultural critics, educators, and concerned parents gathered skeptically, sternly, and anxiously in front of the television set and passed judgment upon the ""tasteless"" Beavis and Butt-head show. And in an ironic reversal, Beavis and Butt-head countered by ascending the cultural hierarchy. The two youths channel-surfed, looking for videos that didn't suck (i.e. those with heavy metal or hardcore rap, those that contained violence, or encouraged genital response.) In becoming the self-proclaimed Siskel and Ebert of music video, they served to evaluate pop culture with an unencumbered bottom line--does a music video ""suck"" or is it ""cool?"" Beavis and Butt-head as a television show, was certainly towards the lower end of traditional scales of cultural ""quality."" But these two animated ""slackers"" evaluated other media, and so pronounced their own critical opinions and erected their own taste hierarchies. Beavis and Butt-head had their own particular brand of ""taste:"" they determined acceptability and unacceptability, invoking, while simultaneously upending, notions of ""high"" and ""low"" culture. In this, they entered that hallowed sphere of criticism, where they competed with others in overseeing the public good and preserving the place and status of artistic evaluation. They disregarded other accepted forms of authority, refusing to acknowledge their own limited perspectives. But like other critics, this was an important part of their appeal. After all, critics are sought out for straightforward opinion, not muddled oscillation.

In this recuperation of the critical discourse, Beavis and Butt-head joined with their audience, approximating the contradictory impulses of contemporary cynical youth, who mixed their self-delusion with self-awareness. In the case of fans of Beavis and Butt-head, these lines of demarcation indicated both a generational unity and the generation-based barriers between the baby boomers and the ""baby busters."" The reputed cynicism of the ""twentynothings"" was on view as Beavis and Butt-head evoked both a stunted adolescence which was long past and an unsure and seemingly inaccessible future.

Adrift in a sea of strangers in strange locations, Kimble, on the hunt for the one-armed man who actually committed the crime, desperately tries to avoid being captured by Lt. Philip Gerard (Mykelti Williamson, ""The New WKRP in Cincinnati""), who always seems to be only two steps behind. From week to week, Kimble searches city after city for the elusive killer whose capture would finally allow him to prove his innocence and return to his former life. In constant flight in his quest for justice, Kimble touches many lives, but the encounters are ended as suddenly as they have begun when the fugitive is forced to escape to yet another city."" - CBS press release.

CBS premiered the much-hyped new action series on its Friday night lineup, which included fellow action series ""Nash Bridges"" and newcomer ""CSI."" Many predicted the new version of ""The Fugitive"" would become one of CBS's greatest hits, but the show only earned decent ratings for its first episode (curiously, everybody thought ""CSI"" was too morbid and wouldn't live to see a pickup, and it turned out to be the big hit ""The Fugitive"" was supposed to be). From then on ratings fell to an underexpected average, and eventually CBS decided to revitalize its Thursday nights with ratings magnet ""CSI,"" bumping Dick Van Dyke's ""Diagnosis Murder"" to Fridays, where it took ""The Fugitive""'s old time slot. Even with a good lead-in the ratings didn't rise (the show aired opposite ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire,"" which at the time drew huge numbers, giving the show a push to death). At the end of the season, CBS decided to cancel the entire lineup. At least they had the decency to show the series finale - but not to tell the producers not to write in a cliffhanger.

Fast-paced and wildly comedic, the series confronts social and moral issues, while its characters continually stretch the boundaries of the law.

Back-to-back Emmy Award winners James Spader and William Shatner play Alan Shore and Denny Crane, unlikely kindred spirits among the brigade of high-priced litigators at Crane Poole & Schmidt. In addition, Shirley Schmidt (played by five-time Emmy winner Candice Bergen), a founding partner of the firm, continues to help bring order to the chaotic office. She keeps a vigilant eye on all, particularly on Denny Crane, with whom she shares a checkered past.

Continuing to keep the office staff in tow is no-nonsense senior partner Carl Sack (Emmy Award winner John Larroquette), yet another ex-boyfriend of Shirley's, who has a newfound respect for the quirky team. Added to the mix are Jerry Espenson (Emmy Award winner Christian Clemenson), Shore's friend and fellow lawyer who suffers from Aspergers syndrome; and Katie Lloyd (Tara Summers), a young associate who is proving that she can run with the big dogs in the Boston offices.

Suddenly, instead of simply whodunit, solving crimes was a matter of howdunit, and with what size shoe, and whether anyone left behind traces of evidence that the blue ALS light could pick up. Now that gritty approach to crime known as forensic science makes its way from Las Vegas to the streets of Florida in CSI: Miami. A whole new team of crime scene investigators is on hand to probe the seamy underside of what some refer to as Cuba North and others call Georgia South. Consider it a tropical blend of people, culture, nightlife and, of course, the occasional killing or two. Just as you do in Vegas, come for the crime, stick around for the clues. And there's always a clue.

The Team

Horatio Caine is the lead criminologist, sort of the Grissom of the spin-off. But he's got a dangerous edge and a ""blind allegiance to justice."" Tim Speedle was a young, well-educated criminalist who did his job in honor of his high school friend, who died two years after he was paralyzed in a snowmobile accident. He died on duty when he was shot in a jewelry store while investigating a murder. Eric Delko is a funny and lovable character, now working as a CSI, specializing in underwater recovery. Alexx Woods is a young coroner. Alexx has the education that has earned her the nickname ""knowologist,"" and she often challenges the other CSIs. She is known to talk to the victims. Calleigh Duquesne is the team's ballistics expert, sometimes known as the ""bullet girl."" Ryan Wolfe is the newest member of the team.

The third-year drama depicts the American landscape -- as seen through the youthful Pryor family of Philadelphia as they brace for the cultural turbulence ahead that still resonates in this contemporary era. Seventeen-year-old Meg Pryor (Brittany Snow, “Guiding Light”) is shedding her “good girl” image as she and her outspoken best friend Roxanne (Vanessa Lengies, “Popular Mechanics for Kids”) continue to pursue their dreams of making a difference as they struggle through the transition from teenager to adult. While they continue to dance on Dick Clark’s locally produced “American Bandstand,” they find -- as seniors at East Catholic High School -- that the world around them is growing ever closer with issues of the war, racism, feminism, and even teen marriage and pregnancy. At the same time, Meg’s mother Helen (three-time Emmy nominee Gail O’Grady, “NYPD Blue”) continues to face the challenge of the era’s modern woman, working and holding the family together. The family’s patriarch, Jack Pryor (Tom Verica, “Providence”), braces himself for the sociological and economic changes as he prepares to run for city councilman, and JJ (Will Estes, “7th Heaven”), a U.S. Marine fighting in Vietnam, struggles to find his way home to his family and his ex-fiancee, Beth Mason (Rachel Boston, “The Andy Dick Show”), who is pregnant with their child. In addition, adolescent Will (Ethan Dampf, “Collateral Damage”) tries to fit in at school after successful polio surgery, and smarty-pants Patty (Sarah Ramos) tries to find a balance between her brilliant mind and social acceptance among her high school peers. African-American father Henry Walker (Jonathan Adams, “The American Embassy”) remains hopeful that his partnership in Jack Pryor’s electronics store is a sign of positive social changes to come. However, the politics of the time continue to show him that the needs of the black community are not being met. Meanwhile, his son Sam (Arlen Escarpeta, “The Shield”) has mixed feelings concerning the evolving events as he starts his freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania on a track scholarship which forces him on a path of self-discovery. The drama embraced contemporary musicians as guest stars who portray classic 1960s icons on “American Bandstand.” Last season’s guest stars include Kelly Clarkson (as Brenda Lee), Nick Lachey (as Tom Jones), Alicia Keys (as Fontella Bass), and Hilary and Haylie Duff (as The Shangri-Las).",60.0,Share Dreams with your Family.,68.0,20,Generally favorable,0,1,Insufficient scores,False

With a rocky start in the ratings, Family Ties rose to number 2 after it was placed in the prized time-slot right after The Cosby Show and remained there from 1984 until 1987.

The series centered around the Keaton family, Steven and his wife Elyse, both flower children of the 1960's.  They had four children, Alex, Mallory, Jennifer and Andrew, who was born in 1985.

What was unique about Family Ties was that it blended family comedy with politics.  The 1960's flower children, Steven and Elyse clashed with the 1980's conservative, Alex.  The show, in a way, showed the changing values during the Reagan era.  Besides political views, Family Ties covered a number of controversial topics ranging from suicide to racism to drug dependency.

Skippy was a neighbor who had a never-ending crush on Mallory.  Ellen was Alex's first serious girlfriend.  After breaking up with her, he became seriously involved with Lauren, a psychology student and Nick Moore was Mallory's serious boyfriend.

1000301716,Sons & Daughters,2006-03-07,1.0,Unknown,"Sons & Daughters is an ABC sitcom that stars Fred Goss (""Significant Others"") in this unique hybrid comedy series that offers a mix of improvisational and scripted humor in an unadulterated look at marriage, raising children and living in close proximity to an extended family. Series creators Goss and Nick Holly borrow from their own middle-American, middle-class upbringings to deliver a very real and relatable modern-day family comedy.

At the center of the family dynamic is Cameron (Goss), happily married to his second wife, Liz (Gillian Vigman, ""Mad TV""), and the father of three children with her. One of the speed bumps on their road to domestic bliss comes from Cameron's resentful teenaged son from his first marriage who recently moved in and is not adjusting well to life with his father and new step-family. 

Cameron's life is further complicated by his sister, Sharon (Alison Quinn), and her husband, Don (Jerry Lambert), seemingly happily married with two teenaged children -- yet both in deep denial on several issues, including a current years-long sex drought. 

Cameron and Sharon's very pretty younger stepsister, Jenna (Amanda Walsh) -- the ""it girl"" when she was in high school -- had her career plans derailed by becoming a single mom. She continues to be attracted to ""bad"" boys like Tommy White, AKA Whitey (Greg Pitts), and not to the nice guys -- like Wylie (Desmond Harrington) -- who are attracted to her. 

The three siblings' parents, Colleen (Dee Wallace) and Wendal (Max Gail), are extremely devoted to their adult children and their grandchildren but, not surprisingly, have some issues of their own. Colleen, a little uptight and impulsively judgmental, both likes and dislikes the safe and comfortable environment that husband Wendal has provided for 25 years. A good guy, Wendal juggles and struggles with the varied relationships he has with his extended family members. ",30.0,,68.0,26,Generally favorable,0,0,Insufficient scores,False

His ""Ali G"" character is a white rapper who hosts his   own talk show in which he asks guests outlandish questions about politics,   the media and (mostly) their personal lives. Most guests believe Ali G is   perfectly serious about his questions, despite their absurd nature. Another   popular character is ""Borat Sagdiyev,"" an immigrant from Kazakhstan   who often embarrasses those whom he is interviewing by engaging in   anti-Semitic, misogynistic speech and strange Kazakh customs. Another regular   character on Da Ali G Show is ""Bruno,"" a gay Austrian television   personality who typically ridicules his guests by having them offer   exaggerated praise or criticism of celebrities. Both Borat and Bruno would   later appear in successful American features films.

How many times have we heard those words? The Real World was the first reality show on tv, premiering in 1992. It is still on the air, about to air it's 21st season, set in Brooklyn. When The Real World was created, it created a new genre of television that years later would be copied by other networks and become almost an obsession around the world. MTV originally wanted to make a soap opera, but the costs were too high, so they thought ""what if we could get rid of writers, and scripts, and sets?"". That resulted on the first Real World, set in NY neighborhood of SoHo, Manhattan, where 7 people that had never met before had to live in a house together for some time.

As the years went by, The Real World slowly gained its shape and space. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Miami, Boston, Seattle, Hawaii, New Orleans, Chicago, Las Vegas, Paris, San Diego, Philadelphia, Austin, Key West, Denver, Sydney and now Hollywood...all these locations have hosted the show. Auditions to be a cast member today attract hundreds of thousands of people in hopes to be one of the strangers in the house. Living rent-free for 6 months in a very hip house with very interesting (and often annoying) roommates, and being on an internationally broadcast tv show is quite attractive to people in their late teens/early 20s.

How much of the show is actually true we'll never know. A lot of what we see on tv is edited to make it look like it all happened in a certain timeline. All the houses have cameras everywhere, and there's a clause in the contract of each housemate that says they're not allowed to go places where the cameras are not allowed in. And all the sounds are taped in a separate way, so, according to Melissa from New Orleans, a lot of times when they're talking and you can only see the back of their heads, the words you hear might not be the words they actually said at the time. Edited or not, none of the scenes aired on the show are acted. They all happened, without scripts.

Each cast member receives around $250 per week, plus their house expenses paid (not including food. That's why every time a parent comes over, they cook). Anything else they want, they have to pay for. Plus, they don't get to take any of all the cool stuff you see in the house.

Today, The Real World is shown in several countries, and local versions of the show have already been made. Loving it or hating it, you just know it's here.

•The ""Tool Time"" audience is ""Home Improvement""'s actual live studio audience.

•While taping some episodes of Tool Time, Tim sometimes asks an unseen character Klaus to play music for Tool Time segments. Klaus Landsberg worked in the sound department on ""Home Improvement"".

•Colleges and universities in Michigan sent star 'Allen, Tim' sweaters and T-shirts to wear on the air, and he did.

•The name Binford Tools, the company that sponsor's the Tool Time show, is named after an anthropologist who made several new discoveries regarding stone age and tools.

•There is a running gag regarding the Taylor's neighbor, Wilson; his face is always concealed from about the nose down. In most episodes, Wilson was being shot from behind a fence, but in later episodes where he got out more often, camera shots, actor movements, and prop placements were carefully orchestrated so that his full face was not revealed. In fact, during all the curtain calls for the show (except the series finale curtain call, where his entire face was shown), actor Earl Hindman, who played Wilson, would bring a miniature picket fence to hold in front of his face so that it would remain hidden from view.

•The character Wilson is based on Tim Allen's childhood memories where he was too short to see over a fence, and was therefore unable to see his neighbor.

•Originally, actress Frances Fisher was cast as Jill Taylor but was replaced with Patricia Richardson 4 days before the pilot episode was taped.

•Richard Karn's wife, Tudi Roche, would occasionally make appearances on the show as Jill's sister Carrie.

•The full names of the older two Taylor boys were Bradley Michael Taylor and Randall William Taylor. (Mark's full name isn't mentioned during the series.)

•The label ""WLS"" was frequently used to cover up real corporate logos. WLS is the Chicago affiliate of ABC.

•While meeting with Bud Harper, Tim is told ""...Heidi tested better than Santa Claus."" Tim Allen played Santa Claus in Santa Clause, The (1994).

•As a running gag, whenever Tim enters the basement, he always bangs his head on a large pipe hanging overhead.

•The character 'Tim Taylor' was ranked #20 in TV Guide's list of the ""50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time"" (20 June 2004 issue).

The show was a hit for the Fox Broadcasting Company network, and its main characters and slogans (e.g., ""The Truth Is Out There"", ""Trust No One"", ""I Want to Believe"") became pop culture touchstones. The X-Files is seen as a defining series of the 1990s, coinciding with the era's widespread mistrust of governments, interest in conspiracy theories and spirituality, and the belief in the existence of extraterrestrial life.

TV Guide called The X-Files the Second greatest cult television show and the 37th best television show of all time. In 2007, Time magazine included it on a list of the ""100 Best TV Shows of All Time."" In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it Classic Sci-fi and the fourth best TV show in the last 25 years.

This long running FOX drama lasted nine seasons and focused on the exploits of FBI Agents Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, John Doggett and Monica Reyes and their investigations into the paranormal. From genetic mutants and killer insects to a global conspiracy concerning the colonisation of Earth by an alien species, this mind-boggling, humourous and occasionally frightening series created by Chris Carter has been one of the world's most popular sci-fi/drama shows since its humble beginnings in 1993.

So sit back and enjoy the fascinating world of The X-Files.

The entire nine seasons of The X-Files are now available on DVD!

Take me out to the black, tell them I ain't coming back. Burn the land and boil the sea, you can't take the sky from me......There's no place I can be since I found Serenity, you can't take the sky from me.""

Firefly is set five hundred years from today in a new planetary system after humanity abandons ""Earth That Was"". Under the leadership of Malcolm Reynolds, a renegade who fought against the new unified central government (the ""Alliance""), the crew of the Firefly-class vessel Serenity struggles to survive any way they can. They fly between the border planets to keep away from the Alliance and below its radar. This series was described as a ""science fiction western"" but is different from other space-based shows as it features no aliens.

(For stations and individuals seeking the intended air order of the series as specified by creator Joss Whedon, as opposed to the order Fox originally aired them or that they are informing stations is the order they should be shown in, see here)

Each of the crew members has a special role:

Malcolm Reynolds holds the duty of Captain - he is a defeated soldier who opposed the unification of the planets by the Alliance to no avail. He strives to keep all his crew members on task and Serenity flying safely, while trying to make a living and do the right thing...in his rather flexible moral framework.
Zoe (aka The Soldier) is extremely loyal to Reynolds as she served with him during the war and owes her life to him. Zoe has the strength and experience to take command of the ship, if necessary.
Wash is Serenity's pilot (and Zoe's husband) - unassuming, self-deprecating, and calm with a sense of humor.  Kaylee is the ship's mechanic - an experienced engineer who keeps Serenity flying.
Inara is a 'Registered Companion,' most easily described as a high-priced courtesan or geisha.  She is also the person with the highest social standing on the ship and acts as the crew's  Ambassador.
Jayne is the muscle of the crew.  A tough, uncultured Mercenary, unpleasant and offensively direct, but loyal to those on his crew...usually.

The newcomers are:

Simon Tam is the Doctor on Serenity and comes from a wealthy family and has a privileged upbringing. He has spent his life savings and future to save his sister, River.
River (aka The Fugitive) was experimented on by the government. Her psychic visions (a result of the experiments) are taken at first as babble by the crew but they slowly come to realize that there's more going on than what shows on the surface.

The series was very successful for CBS, lasting 7 seasons (163 episodes). Reruns from the series continue to air on Lifetime.  In 1995, Delta Burke reconciled with the series creators and reprised her role of Suzanne Sugarbaker for the far less successful spin-off Women of the House, which co-starred Teri Garr and Patricia Heaton.  Carter, Burke, and Bloodworth-Thomason had all previously worked together on the 1982-83 sitcom Filthy Rich, from which a lot of dialogue in Designing Women was recycled.

Allison DuBois (Arquette) is a strong-willed young mother of three, a devoted wife and law student who begins to suspect that she can talk to dead people, see the future in her dreams, and read people's thoughts. Fearing for her mental health, she turns for support to her husband Joe (Jake Weber), an aerospace engineer, who slowly comes to believe that what his wife is telling him just might be true. The real challenge is convincing her boss, D.A. Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) -- and the other doubters in the criminal justice system -- that her psychic abilities can give them the upper hand when it comes to solving violent and horrific crimes whose mysteries often reside with those who live beyond the grave.

Sofia Vassilieva and Maria Lark also star as Ariel and Bridgette, the eldest two DuBois children. David Cubitt stars as Detective Lee Scanlon, who Allison often works with on cases.

During season three Joe lost his job, and he developed an invention during season four that led him to a new job opportunity. At the end of season three, Allison's abilities were discovered by the public, causing Devalos to be removed from his position as the D.A. and Allison to lose her job. Season four saw Allison finding a new working partner, while she still sometimes worked with Scanlon and helped Devalos in an effort to get his job back.  At the end of season four, Devalos reclaimed his position as the D.A. of Phoenix and hired Allison to work for him once again.  The program's fifth season saw Allison returning to the D.A.'s office, her powers more interesting and varied than ever. With her secret out in the open, Allison gained some unique opportunities, but also sometimes had to work to fend off requests for things such as private readings

Out of fear, Bob agrees to help make the world a better place.  Without any hints or suggestions from God, Bob is all on his own to prove that humanity deserves to be saved.

Groundbreaking producer Dick Wolf presides over his popular, Emmy Award-winning Law & Order franchise with Law & Order: Criminal Intent, broadcast on NBC during its first six seasons and then moved to NBC Universal sibling USA Network beginning with season seven. This legal crime drama is unique among the other franchise programs in that it offers an additional dimension by exposing major crimes from the criminal's perspective. Vincent D'Onofrio stars as Det. Robert Goren, an exceptionally bright homicide investigator with well-honed instincts that match up favorably with his criminal quarry. Likewise, his partner, Det. Alexandra Eames (Kathryn Erbe), brings an independence and stylish edge to her work that meshes well in tandem with Goren.

In the fifth season, they were joined by Det. Mike Logan (Chris Noth), who had finally worked his way back from a ten-year exile to Staten Island.

Logan has worked with three partners. Carolyn Barak (Annabella Sciorra) was introduced in the fifth season as the meticulous and measured counterpart to the fiery Logan. Megan Wheeler (Julianne Nicholson) joined major case in the sixth season as an equally brainy detective but with a bit of a wild side. Nola Falacci (Alicia Witt) worked with Logan for part of the seventh season while Wheeler was on another assignment (Nicholson's maternity leave). A hot-headed Irish-Italian mix, Falacci gave Logan a turn as the level-headed partner. Goren also worked briefly with another detective, G. Lyn Bishop (Samantha Buck), while Eames was on maternity leave (Erbe's real maternity leave).

Their commanding officer during the first five seasons, Capt. James Deakins (Jamey Sheridan), was a competent but ambitious political character who knew how to survive and thrive behind the scenes. All of them often butted heads with the no-nonsense Assistant District Attorney Ron Carver (Courtney B. Vance), a stickler for the crucial legal details for the first five seasons.

The sixth season introduced Eric Bogosian as Capt. Danny Ross to replace Jamey Sheridan. There was no replacement for the A.D.A. character.

René Balcer, a ten-year veteran of the original Law & Order series, developed Law & Order: Criminal Intent and served as head writer, executive producer and showrunner for the first five seasons. Warren Leight took over as showrunner and executive producer in seasons six and seven. Peter Jankowski and Norberto Barba are also executive producers.",60.0,"In New York City's war on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

Forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan, who works at the Jeffersonian Institution and writes novels as a sideline, has an uncanny ability to read clues left behind in a victim's bones. Consequently, law enforcement calls her in to assist with murder investigations when the remains are so badly decomposed, burned, or destroyed that the standard identification methods are useless. Brennan has been teamed with Special Agent Seeley Booth, a former Army sniper who mistrusts science and scientists when it comes to solving crimes. Brennan and Booth clash both professionally and personally, but the chemistry between them has grown since they first met and has made them a strong and trusting team. Brennan's equally brilliant colleagues (or ""squints"" as they're often called) at the Jeffersonian's Medico-Legal Lab include earthy and bawdy Angela Montenegro, who's created a unique way to render an original crime scene in a three-dimensional computer image; Dr. Jack Hodgins, who's an expert on insects, spores and minerals, but conspiracy is his hobby; and Brennan's boss Dr. Camille ""Cam"" Saroyan, who replaced Dr. Daniel Goodman after the first season.  Zack Addy, a young prodigy whose genius IQ sometimes distances him from reality, was Brennan's former assistant, but at the end of season three he left the Jeffersonian.

To aid Booth and Brennan in their persisting struggles, psychologist Dr. Lance Sweets signed on in season three as their therapist, and more recently has been hired to work in the lab to provide his unique input on cases.",40.0,"To Unravel A Murder, You Have To Strip It To The Bone.",58.0,44,Mixed or average,73,485,Generally favorable,False

Federal Agent Vincent Terranova (Ken Wahl) is plagued by the question in this innovative take on 80’s cop dramas. Created by veteran hit producer Steven J Cannell, Wiseguy veers from traditional ‘bad guy of the week’ police procedural by breaking the drama into multi-episode story arcs that followed an Organized Crimes Bureau case—and its charismatic criminal suspects—to its logical conclusion. No matter the cost to criminal, victim, or cop.

In the end, Vinnie may have got his man, but the emotional toll of the lies and deceptions he used to get close enough to his prey couldn’t be ignored. But he’s ably backed by his Field Supervisor Frank McPike (Jonathan Banks) and his OCB Lifeguard (Jim Byrnes) on the law-and-order side and his brother Father Pete Terranova (Gerald Anthony) on the spiritual side. Plus many up-and-coming stars (Ray Sharkey, Annette Benning, Billy Vera, Kevin Spacey, Fred Dalton Thompson, Ron Silver, Michael Chiklis) cut their teeth on juicy roles as either flashy but flawed criminals or tragic victims of the same. 

Personal problems and injuries caused Wahl to back out of a fourth season and be replaced by Steven Bauer, thereby giving the show a new slant and hastening its cancellation. Still, Wiseguy is referenced by many critics and fans as one of the most literate, stylish, audacious, and fun cop shows of the late 80’s.

1000338061,Tales from the Crypt,1989-06-10,7.0,TV-MA,"Based on the legendary and gruesome 1950's EC Comics from publisher, William M. Gaines, this horror anthology featured stories of murder, greed, lust, gore and the supernatural, with touches of humor sprinkled throughout, usually with a twist ending of sorts. Some of Hollywood's biggest names including Demi Moore, Tom Hanks, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Whoopi Goldberg and Michael J. Fox were featured, either in front or behind the camera. Hosting duties fell to everyone's favorite decaying corpse, the Crypt Keeper.
The episodes were based on several comic books by Gaines, which were The Vault of Horror, The Haunt of Fear, Crime SuspenStories, Shock SuspenStories, and, of course, Tales from the Crypt, to name a few.
The success of this series spawned a Saturday morning cartoon series, Tales from the Cryptkeeper, a short-lived Saturday morning gameshow on CBS, Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House, and lots of merchandise. A short-lived TV series based on the EC Comics' Weird Science series, entitled Perversions of Science, was also produced in 1997,  following the same anthology format as Tales from the Crypt,  with wraparound segments featuring a female android  named Chrome. In addition, two feature films, Demon Knight (1995) and Bordello of Blood (1996), were also produced. In 2006, Ritual, a third film originally released overseas (without the Crypt Keeper wraparounds) in 2001, was finally released on DVD. Two other movies based on the EC Comics Tales From the Crypt and The Vault of Horror were released back in 1972 and 1973 respectively. They are not connected to this series in any way, other than the original source.

This show realized creator J. Michael Straczynski's vision of creating a five-season novel for television.  Its stories proved that one person can make a difference, that the choices we make (right or wrong, good or bad) have far-reaching consequences, and that humanity is far greater and nobler than given credit for being.Babylon 5 is a five-mile long space station located in neutral space.  Built by the Earth Alliance in the 2250s, it's goal is to maintain peace among the various alien races by providing a sanctuary where grievances and negotiations can be worked out among duly appointed ambassadors.  A council made up of representatives from the five major space-faring civilizations - the Earth Alliance, Mimbari Federation, Centarui Republic, Narn Regime, and Vorlon Empire - work with the League of Non-Aligned Worlds to keep interstellar relations under control.  Aside from its diplomatic function, Babylon 5 also serves as a military post for Earth and a port of call for travellers, traders, businessmen, criminals, and Rangers.  A floating city home to a quarter of a million humans and aliens is bound to experience problems; Babylon 5 has problems in abundance.  Its senior staff of Earth Alliance officers - along with the most prominent members of the diplomatic community - deal with personal problems, cultural differences, threats to station security, and interstellar crises on a regular basis.  Old prejudices and unresolved issues leftover from the Earth-Mimbari War and the Centauri occupation of Narn lead to unexpected developments.  Pro-Human groups and a corrupt government make the Earth of the future far from paradise.  Telepaths seek refuge from the militant Psi Corps while the Mars colony desires support in its bid for independence.  And then there is the growing presence of Shadows in regions close by and on the Outer Rim of known space.  Fate has decreed that Babylon 5 be crucial to deciding the outcome of all of these conflicts.",45.0,,55.0,13,Mixed or average,88,176,Universal acclaim,False

""Byrne stars as Benjamin Madigan, a handsome, successful and charismatic architect in New York City. He is single, adorable and available and should be making out like a bandit with the ladies. But Benjamin is recently divorced, and after 20 years of being a dutiful husband and provider, he just hasn't got a clue about dating. He is a member of a rare breed of men -- the sexy man completely oblivious to his own sexiness. While his co-workers shove him into the dating world, he is full of the most rudimentary questions, like how soon to call a woman after she gives you her number. For the answers to these and many other questions, Ben can turn to his 16-year-old son, Luke (John Hensley), for whom juggling a series of girlfriends couldn't come more naturally. In addition, Ben's recently widowed father, Seamus (Roy Dotrice, TV's Beauty and the Beast), has just moved in. Seamus is ornery and speaks his mind, and with Luke's help, they might just be able to teach Benjamin a thing or two about dating and women in the 21st century."" (ABC press release)

Kevin Debreno Jonathan LaPaglia, the newest member of Mannion's unit, continues to challenge himself and his partner, Temple, at every turn. Together, Mannion and his team form a modern-day ""Untouchables,"" determined to make the District livable for all its citizens. The District premiered in October 2000 and was the most watched show on Saturday nights until May 2004, often managing to reach the top 20 in its first season. Unfortunately the show has suffered many losses in its short history, including creator Jack Maple and actress Lynne Thigpen.

In May 2004, CBS decided to scrap their Saturday lineup, cancelling fellow Saturday show Hack. The District lasted 4 successful seasons.

1000300348,Clueless,1996-09-20,3.0,TV-G,"Based on the 1995 hit film of the same name, Clueless is a popular half-hour American sitcom. The show aired for three seasons between 1996 and 1999. Clueless began life as part of ABC's popular 'TGIF' strand, but after it had finished it's first run, the network decided to cancel the series. It was a decision they would later regret, when it's re-runs proved a huge ratings winner, even competing with the incredibly successful Sabrina The Teenage Witch. Rival network UPN promptly capitalized on ABC's mistake, and the series found a new home where it aired for two further seasons. In a change to the movie, Rachel Blanchard plays the well natured and complicated, yet, as the shows title suggests, clueless teen soul Cher Horowitz. But many of the movie's cast return to reprise their characters, including Stacey Dash as Cher's sexy, confident and sassy friend Dionne Davenport. Set in the wealthiest parts of Beverley Hills, the show profiled the many loves and lives of Cher and her friends, all equally as rich, pretty and charming as her - all, that is, but the rude and self obsessed Amber Mariens (Elisa Donovan). Without her mother around, young Cher must travel through the trickiest times - those oh-so awkward teenage years - with the guidance of only her friends and father (Michael Lerner, Doug Sheehan). Joining her on her journey, are Murray Duvall (Donald Adeosun Faison) and Sean Holliday  (Sean Holland) who more often than not, find themselves getting into trouble, not doing enough to help or generally just getting it very wrong. As the show developed, and the character's developed, the writing changed. From the relaxed, confident and slow pace of the first season, to the quick, sassy, off-the-cusp and celebrity-reference filled style of the second and third seasons, enter to a new and faster style of editing for the final two seasons with some hillariously well-timed sound effects and musical scores that complimented the jokes with style. Despite all it's good points, Clueless fell victim to the UPN axe and was cancelled in 1999. But the show has now gone into syndication across the world to a brilliant response, most notably from the United Kingdom and the USA. Clueless - one of the late great teen-orientated sitcoms of the '90s.

When Can I See Clueless?

If you're in the US, you can watch complete re-runs of all three seasons on The-N, Monday Through Thursday at 8pm & 11pm. Fans in the UK can see the show on Digital Satellite Network Trouble, Moday to Friday at 18.00 and 22:20.

1000301531,Just Legal,2005-04-01,1.0,Unknown,"“Just Legal” is a fast-paced procedural drama with humor starring Jay Baruchel (‘Undeclared,"" ‘Million Dollar Baby”) and Don Johnson (“Miami Vice, ” “Nash Bridges”) as lawyers who save their clients, and in the process, save themselves. David “Skip” Ross (Baruchel), 19, a brilliant legal prodigy, dreams of becoming a great trial lawyer. When he can't land a job at a prestigious L.A. firm because he's too young, Skip ends up working for Grant Cooper (Johnson). Once a great lawyer, now burnt-out by the realities of life, Cooper is barely scraping by in his beachfront law office. Together, Skip and Cooper become defenders of the accused and crusaders for the unjustly wronged. Their cases vary from stories ripped from today's headlines to clever mysteries with procedural twists. Skip's middle-class parents, Deborah (Veanne Cox, “Erin Brockovich”) and Lenny Ross (Raphael Sbarge, “The Guardian”), and his under-achieving younger brother Tom (newcomer Michael Mitchell), are all extremely proud of Skip's accomplishments, but are also concerned for his well-being, especially when his first case involves proving the innocence of a young woman named Paradise (Peyton List, “The Greatest Game Ever Played”) who has been falsely accused of a gang-related murder. Always the underdogs, forced to do the gritty work of finding clues and tracking down witnesses in the beautiful, but often dangerous world of Southern California, Cooper teaches Skip to be a lawyer and a man, while Skip renews Cooper's faith in the law and himself. Jerry Bruckheimer (“CSI, ” “Cold Case, ” “Without a Trace”), Jonathan Littman (“CSI, ” “Cold Case, ” “Without a Trace”) and Jonathan Shapiro (“The Practice, ” “Boston Legal”) are executive producers for Jerry Bruckheimer Television in association with Warner Bros.

This gentle-hearted series stars John Lithgow as the High Commander of an investigative team sent to Earth on a mission to learn everything about humans and their so-called advanced civilization. Described by its producers as ""Carl Sagan meets the Marx Brothers,"" 3RD ROCK has a clever, distinct point of view seen through the extraterrestrial team who has no other worldly powers except absolute truthfulness.  Dick (John Lithgow, Don Quixote), Harry (French Stewart, Love Stinks), Sally (Kristen Johnston, Austin Powers) And Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, 10 thing I Hate About You), arrive in our world completely innocent, while equipped with superior intelligence to analyze every experience. This bizarre vantage point of an innocent seeing everything for the first time is the comic framework from which to satire the human condition and American society, to look at all of the injustices and absurdities and humorously point them out to us.  3RD ROCK cuts through our taboos and traditions with a childlike inquisitive logic and an impeccably paced humorous twist.

Cate (Katey Sagal) now finds herself in the precarious position of raising three teenagers on her own while holding down a full time job as a hospital nurse near their Detroit-area home. She does, however, get a little relief, thanks to her father, Jim (James Garner), who's been staying at the house since Paul's death. Retired and separated from his wife, Jim mostly spends his days making home improvements to the house - with arguably mixed results - and, in his own inimitable way, gives comfort and guidance to his daughter and grandchildren during their time of need. But the family is thrown for a loop when Cate's wayward nephew, C.J. (David Spade), moves in and finds it hard to resist getting himself into trouble or offering questionable advice to the kids.

Now more than ever, Cate needs to be there for her kids - particularly her daughters. Oldest daughter Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) has matured into a beautiful and popular teenager - especially with the boys. But since her father's death, she has begun to question the importance of running with the ""in crowd"" at school. By contrast, middle child Kerry (Amy Davidson) is intelligent and cute, but her continued lack of self-confidence has led her to hide behind a mask of sarcasm - which makes it difficult for her to get in touch with her true feelings. And youngest child Rory (Martin Spanjers), fondly referred to as ""The Boy,"" is trying to fill his father's shoes by becoming the man of the family, while at the same time entering the world of puberty and discovering one of life's true mysteries - girls.

Dating boys and fitting in with their peers will once again become a top priority for the girls. But no matter what, Cate will continue to enforce Paul's number one rule - ""If you make my daughters cry, I'll make you cry.""

Its tenure lasted from 1993 through its end in 2000. The people in the world of teenager Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) continue to test his theories about life and relationships, on the fourth season of ""Boy Meets World."" 
Topanga (Danielle Fishel) is one person who continues to test Cory's outlook and emotions in the ways of young love. Though they are back together again after a bumpy start, anything could happen when it comes to their relationship. 
His best friend, Shawn (Rider Strong), no longer lives with English teacher Jonathan Turner ( Anthony Tyler Quinn), but with his truck-driver dad, who has moved back to town. Cory, who was instrumental in bringing the father and son together, hopes that Shawn's mother will also rejoin the family. 
Cory's older brother, Eric (Will Friedle), failed to get accepted to a four-year college, even after all of his amusing yet sincere efforts to do so. He must now figure out if he's either going to make a fresh start living out of town or stay within the comforts of home.

Eric isn't the only one trying to decide what's best for his life. Their dad (William Russ) is also at a point where he must decide his future. He's worked at the grocery store since his teenage years and wonders if it isn't time to explore a different career.  Fortunately, there's always Cory's mom, Amy (Betsy Randle), to give everyone guidance and all sorts of helpful advice; and his little sister, Morgan (Lindsay Ridgeway), to add her ten-year-old point of view. 
At high school, the ever-present and wise Principal George Feeny (William Daniels) continues to make Cory's and Shawn's lives more challenging. The principal even gets involved with former student Eric as he makes some educational decisions. Feeny, who still lives next door to the Matthews, has a unique way of always seeming to know what unpredictable antics the young men are up to.

Chef Ramsay demands quality and the intensity of the challenges is beyond anything the contestants can ever imagine. Split into two teams, they must compete against each other to provide their very best in the kitchen. If they do, they are lavishly rewarded with everything from extravagant trips to a ride on Ramsay's personal yacht. Those that fail are forced to suffer humiliating punishment.

At the end of each episode, the chef who provided the best performance in Ramsay's opinion on the losing team is chosen to select two chefs from their own team for elimination. They must then give their reasons for their selection. Though one of these two chefs may be eliminated, Ramsay is under no obligation to choose either, and the final decision as to who is sent home is made solely by him.

From Waffle House chefs to executive chefs, the competitors are tested in every way possible, from leadership skills to culinary skills. Traditional challenges include a taste-test of everyone's palette and special events such as birthdays and weddings. The chefs, however, must always be on their toes, as they never know when surprises may be coming.

1000300196,Family Matters,1989-09-22,9.0,TV-G,"A perfect spin-off from Perfect Strangers: Family Matters focused on Harriet Winslow (the elevator operator from the Chronicle) and her family of sorts. Carl Winslow, her husband, was a dutiful cop, and a gruff and lovable father to three kids: Eddie Winslow, the rebel son; Laura Winslow, the smart-aleck daughter; and cute little Judy Winslow. They had opened their home to Harriet's sister, Rachel Crawford and her little baby son Richie, and in the very first episode, Carl had to open his home to his cool and streetwise mother, Estelle Winslow, whether he wanted to or not. Everything was going along just fine until one day, Steve Urkel, the inventive nerd, barged into their home and eventually, into their hearts. Steve had a killer crush on Laura, but she would never give him the time of day. Steve Urkel was intended to be a one-shot appearance, but his popularity with the fans won him the number-one spot as America's favorite nerd.As the show went on, the characters and the stories evolved. Richie grew from a little baby into a rambunctious and impressionable little boy. The stories started revolving around Steve and his incredible inventions, which became the greatest sight gags on the show. In almost every episode, Steve ends up breaking furniture, windows, and Carl's patience. Eddie and Laura each had best buddies to hang out with: Eddie had dim-witted yet lovable Waldo Geraldo Faldo,and Laura had faithful and true-blue gal pal Maxine. The greatest mystery of Family Matters is Judy and Rachel's sudden disappearances from the show, but Rachel made guest appearances whenever possible.To stop Steve from chasing her, Laura matched him up with perky-yet-pushy Myra Monkhouse. Steve loved Myra physically, but his emotions will always go to Laura.  Eddie had his share of steady girlfriends, and even he had an Urkel chasing him- Myrtle May Urkel, Steve's cousin from Biloxi (Jaleel White also). Every so often, Steve uses one of his inventions to turn himself into debonair, irresistable lover Stefan Urquelle or karate hero Bruce Lee to draw Laura closer to him, much to Myra's chagrin.At the end of season 6, the Winslows welcomed Steve into their home when Steve's family went to Russia. Pretty soon, Richie hung out with 3J, a tough, streetwise kid always running from the children's home. The Winslows then adopted 3J as one of their kids, as they did with Steve.In the final season, Family Matters - along with Step by Step - moved to CBS, and Steve slowly matured from the annoying nerd that he used to be. This was when Laura started falling in love with Steve, and Myra got kicked to the curb, but she vowed to get her ""Stevie-kins"" back. Also, the original Harriette, JoMarie Peyton, had left the show in mid-season and Judyann Elder took her role. Steve and Laura got engaged, but they never had a wedding because CBS dropped the ax on the show. But, nevertheless, Family Matters had a great successful run and is one of the longest running African-American comedies ever.

Leno has created his own unique late-night style with a combination of humor, talk and entertainment each night at 11:35 p.m. ET - the wee hours when viewers want to wind down with a few laughs before drifting off to dreamland. Considered by many to be a ""variety"" show, ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" features a nightly monologue and news-making guests, as well as ongoing comedy segments including ""Headlines,"" ""Tonight Show Side Show,"" ""Jaywalking,"" and ""Battle of Jaywalking All-Stars."" The result is a unique look at today's pop culture. Honored for Emmy Awards in 1995 and 1996, ""The Tonight Show"" was also voted by readers of ""TV Guide"" readers as 'Favorite Late Night Show' in 1999 and 2000. Other notable achievements include: Leno's exclusive interview with Senator John Glenn and the astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery; a pay-per-view wrestling match between Leno and Hulk Hogan; ""The Tonight Show Unplugged"" in response to California's recent power crisis; a sum of $360,200 raised for The Twin Towers Fund from auctioning Leno's celebrity-signed motorcycle; and a special 2001 Thanksgiving show broadcast live on Armed Forces Radio and Television Services to entertain U.S. military personnel worldwide.

""The Kingdom"") as a point of inspiration, master of horror Stephen King gives Kingdom Hospital a unique and menacing American touch. Kingdom is a hospital whose bizarre population includes a brilliant surgeon who lives in the basement, a nearly blind security guard and a nurse who regularly faints at the sight of blood. But when patients and staff hear the voice of a girl crying through the halls and a patient destined for life as a paraplegic miraculously recovers, they are dismissive of any suggestion of mysticism or unseen powers at their own peril.

Andrew McCarthy (plays Dr. Hook, a surgeon who lives in the hospital basement. Oscar nominee Diane Ladd (Alice) is Mrs. Druse, a hypochondriac whose psychic abilities lead her to the hospital. Fellow Oscar nominee Bruce Davison (The Practice & X-Men) will play Dr. Stegman, an arrogant, but inept physician.

The series is set up to play out like a book.  The episode you watch picks up right where the last episode left off.  Not in the sense of 24 that goes hour by hour, but more to the form of chapter by chapter.  King himself was quoted as saying ""Remember that Kingdom Hospital is a ""novelization for television"". Like a novel, it will pay back dividends but you will have to give it a little bit of time.""  King himself describes the show as a mix of ER and The Shining.

1000300004,Clerks,2000-05-31,1.0,TV-MA,"(Also known as ""Clerks: The Animated Series"") This animated series, based on Kevin Smith's 1994 film of the same name, centers on Dante Hicks and Randal Graves, the clerks at The Quick Stop and RST Video. These ""slackers"" spend most of their time spoofing pop culture and whining about their miserable lives. Adding color to their lives are the resident ""hetero-life partners"" Jay and Silent Bob, who hang out and sell fireworks outside the store. Every show needs an evil villain, so to accommodate, Leonardo Leonardo was created -- a rich, gay psychopath, who was the evil foil for our heroes. Leonardo's sidekick, the menacing Plug, was a robot. NBA player Charles Barkley voiced himself in nearly every episode, playing the nemesis of Jay and Silent Bob. And Lando was created in episode 3 to address the lack of black characters in the show.  Utilizing the animation, the makers inserted tons of film and television spoofs, and cameos from many stars.This short lived series not only set a record for the length of time it spent on the air, but for the length of the titles as well! The show was green lighted by ABC for six episodes, but the release date kept getting pushed back and after a spot on the Superbowl, they finally got around to airing the series on May 31, 2000. After playing the show for two weeks, the series was abruptly jerked off the air, even though the additional four episodes were scheduled. Plans were made to cut the episodes into a feature film, but this idea was eventually scrapped and all six episodes appeared on video and DVD the following year. Also worth noting, Leonardo Leonardo was based on (and originally voiced by) Alan Rickman (Dogma, Die Hard, Galaxy Quest), but the execs at ABC didn't want Rickman, so Alec Baldwin stepped in to do the voice.On the video version, the real Jay and Silent Bob come out to introduce each episode (and there's a special appearance by Randal). On the DVD, these clips appear after an animated version of Jay and Silent Bob holding up a card with the episode number. The DVD also includes an audio commentary, two featurettes, animatics, the Superbowl spot, and a long promo made for a film/comic convention. As a DVD-ROM bonus, there are script/storyboards and character profiles.On December 22, 2002, all six episodes premiered in a marathon on Comedy Central.

Popular, affluent Nathan basks in the hero-worship of the town, as the star of his high school team. And both boys are the son of former college ball player, Dan Scott, whose long ago choice to abandon Lucas and his mother Karen, will haunt him long into his life with wife Deb, and their son Nathan. Until now, Dan has managed to keep his two sons far from each other. But the past and present collide sharply when Tree Hill's basketball coach recruits Lucas for his team, much to the chagrin of Nathan and Daddy Dan. And the siblings natural rivalry only intensifies when they set their sights on the same girl, Peyton Sawyer. The residue of the past lingers far into the future for the residents of Tree Hill, even as a new generation is rising. Tree Hill follows the lives and loves of these two brothers, their friends and their family as they navigate high school, marriage, and finally... adulthood. One Tree Hill theme song:

Despite the rules that governed the way law-enforcement officers were supposed to act. Walker's approach closely resembled the ""eye for an eye"" school of crime fighting.

His partner is young Jimmy Trivette, who had grown up in the slums of Baltimore and used football as his ticket to a college education and a career with the Dallas Cowboys until he busted his shoulder. Despite Jimmy's belief in computers and scientific criminology, working with Walker, always seemed to leave him bruised and sore--when Walker was trying to get information or take people into custody it was more than likely there would be a fistfight or karate kicks. County Assistant D.A. Alex Cahill, his sometimes girlfriend, frowned on Walker's methods, even if they did get results.

When not on duty Walker and the others hung out at C.D.'s, the saloon/restaurant owned by his buddy C.D. Parker, a former Ranger forced into early retirement after taking a bullet in the knee, who still provided help and advice on cases. Uncle Ray was the wise old Native American who had raised Walker.

1000301068,Tarzan,2003-10-05,2.0,Unknown,"This thrilling, contemporary twist on the timeless legend of Tarzan turns the popular tale into an urban adventure, an intriguing mystery and, most of all, an unconventional crime drama. Two decades ago, young John Clayton's parents died in a plane crash and left him alone in the African jungle, where he grew up among apes and other wild animals. A solitary human in the pure and primal order of this untamed world, John Clayton emerged as the fearless Tarzan (newcomer Travis Fimmel). Captured by his billionaire uncle, Richard Clayton (Mitch Pileggi, The X-Files), the CEO of powerful Greystoke Industries, Tarzan is returned, against his will, to his family's home in New York City.Within the Clayton family, Tarzan's return has unleashed rivalries that have festered for decades. His uncle Richard is bitterly estranged from his younger sister Katherine Clayton the witty, sardonic and beautiful newspaper publisher who is Tarzan's aunt. While Richard believes that his desire to rehabilitate Tarzan and make him a real member of society is in Tarzan's own best interest, Katherine believes that what Tarzan really needs is their help and support as he finds his own way in this strange new world. Now that their nephew has returned from the dead as Tarzan, Richard and Katherine have squared off in a new battle. While they are both driven by love - for Tarzan and for the family - they also know that whoever controls Tarzan, controls Greystoke Industries as well.
Resisting captivity, Tarzan escapes into the concrete jungle of New York City where he encounters the strong-willed NYPD detective Jane Porter (stage actress Sarah Wayne Callies). Jane's perfectly ordered life is turned upside-down by her attraction to Tarzan and his dangerous yet profoundly untainted morality. Romantically involved with another member of the force, Detective Michael Foster (Johnny Messner, Tears of the Sun), Jane is left to choose between reason and instinct, civilization and pure humanity, her head and her heart. While the rivalry between Tarzan and Michael quickly becomes explosive, the sudden shift in Jane's world also affects her partner Sam Sullivan (Miguel A. Núñez, Jr., Scooby Doo). Though he appears brash and irreverent, Sam is a dedicated cop, and he is stunned by Jane's reckless behavior and her obsession with this mysterious fugitive. Now that Tarzan is a part of her life, Jane sees everything differently, especially her work with the police force. Crimes of violence, greed and revenge suddenly take on a deeper and more disturbing meaning, and she is more troubled than ever before by what she sees. Looking at society from Tarzan's perspective, Jane begins to wonder what it really means to be ""civilized."" Drawn together from different worlds, Tarzan and Jane share passions that are only heightened by the gulf between them. Tarzan's feelings for Jane now keep him in New York, but his view of the world is unchanged. Confronted with a city that exists in shades of gray, Tarzan still sees everything in black and white. When he comes across an innocent person in trouble, he reacts swiftly and sometimes brutally, guided by the sense of justice that is the core of his being.Driven by his devotion to Jane and his unwavering sense of right and wrong, Tarzan makes his way through New York City, using instinct, his unique physical abilities and wits sharpened by years in the jungle. Tarzan is a modern day hero - an extraordinary man living in the real and all-too-brutal modern world.
Tarzan is from executive producers Laura Ziskin (Spider-Man, Pretty Woman), David Gerber (The Lost Battalion), P.K.

Since he became plant manager at an L.A. airplane parts factory, he has handled a complicated and tumultuous job, a strong but challenging marriage, two rebellious children and a mother who can't keep track of her own lies about his childhood -- all with his sense of humor intact.His affable compadre, Ernie (Valente Rodriguez, ""Erin Brokovich""), still ribs George about his high-powered management position at the plant, but always lends a hand when George needs him. Ernie, who still lives with his mother and father, has learned some fathering skills of his own after foster-parenting a troubled twelve-year-old boy.Though their marriage has had some close calls, George and his devoted wife, Angie (Constance Marie), still chose to renew their vows recently. Angie deals with his questionable decisions and freewheeling approach to parenthood and his mother's insensitive wisecracks with the patience of a saint -- and some guidance from her father, Vic (Emiliano Díez) -- but her drive to build a still unprofitable wedding-planning business has nearly driven their family to the poor house.

He and the Freakylinks team investigate the reasons behind Adam's death while hunting down stories for the website, and their weekly exploits bring them in contact with the ""weird, the unusual, the occult, the paranormal, and the just plain silly"".

""Freakylinks.com"" became one of the most active sites on the web before the series even aired, but all those hits did not translate into good ratings for the show.

It's also the first U.S. English-language drama to be shot by Fox Telecolombia in BogotÃ¡, Colombia. Mental is a drama that explores the complexity of the human brain like never seen before. Every week there is a different patient with a different crisis. Every crisis is a mystery, a confusion, or even a wrong diagnosis from other doctors. Originally from the UK, Jack Gallagher is a compulsive traveler who has taken a position as the director of a psychiatric hospital in L.A. to be in the same city as his twin sister. Fascinated with the power of the human brain since he was a child, Jack approaches psychiatry with unorthodox treatments and slightly unusual methods for the sake of his patients' mental health. He is overseen by Nora, the department administrator who is also his ex-lover.

For Jack, each case is like a puzzle. Jack has the ability to see what his patients have in their heads, to see the world as they do and give them a perspective on their own worlds. Unfortunately, some of his colleagues don't agree with his methods, and they will do anything to get him out of the clinic. Day after day he fights against his sister's schizophrenia, afraid he'll end up as one more victim of this serious mental illness. He is ready to break some rules for the well-being of his patients. For him the most important thing is to get into the mind of his patients, seeing reality as they do and make them understand that the doctors are a part of their recovery.
